I spent most of the last week doing research and ordering parts samples and testing equipment, trying to get everything set up for this project.

<strong>Things I have ordered.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>$75 USD - <a href="http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/89-led">100x Superflux "Piranha" RGB LEDs common-anode</a> ($50 for the LEDs + 25 for shipping). From <a href="http://evilmadscience.com/">evilmadscience.com</a>. Definitely not the cheapest place for RGB LEDs but they had the "Piranha" style ones that I wanted in a common-anode and had good reputation online. I selected the Piranha style LEDs after getting a great answer to my question. <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/11790/what-makes-a-good-rgb-led">What makes a good RGB LED</a>.</li>
	<li>$0 - Sample chips from <a href="http://www.ti.com/">Texas instruments</a>. World class sales team, when I called them to talk about the particulars of their chips they offered to send me a few samples. 12hr later the chips where in my hand. Thank you Texas instruments. They also explained to me what a sink driver is and how it is used on these chips use.
<ul>
	<li>2x, <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc5947.html">TLC5947 - 24-Channel, 12-Bit PWM LED Driver with Internal Oscillato</a>r</li>
	<li>2x, <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc5952.html">TLC5952 - 24-Channel Constant-Current LED Driver with Global Brightness and LED Open Short Detection</a></li>
	<li>2x, <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc5951.html">TLC5951 - 24 Channel, 12Bit PWM LED Driver w/ 7Bit Dot Correction and 3-Group, 8Bit Global Brightness Control</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>$33 USD - 1x, <a href="http://macetech.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=22">OctoBrite DEFILIPPI</a> ($20 for the board and $13 for shipping). Got one for testing before I buy the rest of the boards. This is one of the most expensive parts of this project and if it doesn't work right it will be the most costly mistake.</li>
	<li>$40 CND - ~1750 RPM AC motor with 1/4 shaft. Found a junkyard and priced by its weight. Tested and it works great comes with a pulley as well. Going to do more extensive testing this weekend.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things I still need to get</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring">slip ring</a>, I want to house the power supply in the base below the spinning right. But I need a way to transfer the power up the pole to the electronics and LEDs. You do this with a slip ring. I have contacted a few different <a href="http://www.moog.com/products/slip-rings/commercial-industrial-slip-rings/high-speed-slip-ring-capsules/ac6231/">distributer in Vancouver</a> asking what they suggest. Waiting on a response. If <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/11946/power-for-povdisplay">all else fails</a> I can alway <a href="http://maybevideodoes.de/howto/slipring.html">make my own</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.princessauto.com/power-transmission/driveline/bearings/components/3870219-1-flange-mount-with-bearing">Flange Mount with Bearing</a>. I need a way to mount the main pole in to the box. I'm looking for a rather large one as the pole will have quite a lot of stress on it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.princessauto.com/power-transmission/driveline/drive-pulleys/components/8046310-2_4-finished-bore-sheave">A few pulleys</a>. For the belt between the motor and the main pole.</li>
	<li>The main pole. I am looking for a hollow 6 foot pole with heavy walls. I plan to run wires up the center of the pole and distribute them across the spinning ring.</li>
	<li>A wooden box to house the motor, power supply and other electronics below the spinning ring.</li>
	<li>Micro-controller, Still deciding what one to use.</li>
	<li>Cables and connectors, I will decide this after I do testing on the OctoBrite boards.</li>
</ul>
