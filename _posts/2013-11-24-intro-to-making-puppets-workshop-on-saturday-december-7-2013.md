<p style="padding-left: 30px;">VHS is running another Intro to Making Puppets workshop on Saturday, December 7, 2013!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bring your imaginations, concept art and materials!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All puppet styles are welcome, from finger puppets to sock puppets to "
muppet-style" puppets (whew, trademark lawsuit averted!). Even sock-monkeys are welcome at this artificial creature creation party.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">VHS will try to have some supplies available, including enough polyfoam for the first 10 muppet-style puppets or so. But if you have your heart set on making something specific, we recommend bringing your own supplies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In all cases, scissors, needles, and thread are a good idea.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a finger puppet, we recommend felt in the colours you prefer, and embroidery floss of matching (or interestingly contrasting) colour.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a "
muppet-style" puppet, foam, and a skin material of either synthetic fur or fleece in the colour of your choice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a classic sock puppet, fur, fabric or fleece in the colour or style you prefer. A sock would also work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a sock monkey, you will need a pair of socks, in a pattern and texture that you believe would make an attractive (or appropriately hideous!) monkey. And poly-fill stuffing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you&quot;d like to get prepared early, we will be posting some handy links leading up to the event:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dressew is a good place to get almost everything you will need, with a variety of affordable fur and fabric ends available at reasonable prices in their scrap bin. 337 West Hastings Street Vancouver, (604) 682-6196</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you plan on bringing your own foam, we recommend Discount Foam <a href="http://www.discountfoam.ca/">http://www.discountfoam.ca/</a> , at 6035 Fraser St., (604) 324-2927. The best foam for puppets is reticulated polyfoam in sheets of 1/2€³ thick, and 2€² x 2€² would be enough to build one one standard-sized puppet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>When:</strong>
1 pm, Saturday 7th of December, 2013</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Where:</strong>
