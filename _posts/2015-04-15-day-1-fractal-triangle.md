Made with VHS's Laser cutter. 96 small triangles, 36 medium triangles, 9 large triangles. It took about 5 hours to assemble with Zap straps. I used a 4x8 Sheet of 3mm birch plywood and 250+ Zap straps. The idea came/copied from this burning man project form 2013 [https://wewanttolearn.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/fractal-cult/5](https://wewanttolearn.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/fractal-cult/5)
