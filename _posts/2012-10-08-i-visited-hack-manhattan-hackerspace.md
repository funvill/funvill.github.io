While I was in New York to see <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/">World Maker Faire</a>, I got a chance to visit <a href="http://hackmanhattan.com/">HACK Manhattan</a>.

It was a busy night as they where doing a workshop with the <a href="http://www.robotis.com/xe/ollo_en">OLLO robot kit</a>. The people from OLLO gave us a robot kit to take home with us. It was a lot like <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">lego mindstorms</a>

<a href="/public/uploads/2012/10/OLLO_en_Starter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2891" title="OLLO_en_Starter" src="/public/uploads/2012/10/OLLO_en_Starter-300x133.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="133" /></a>

There space is small, very small but they use the space well and it looked like there was a lot of projects going in various states. I can't help wonder what amazing things they could do if they just had a bit more space.

One f the interesting projects that someone was doing was making a brass lock on the lathe. Drilling out the pings and the tumble, I would love to see it completed.

I dropped off some <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">VHS stickers</a> and took some pictures of their space.
