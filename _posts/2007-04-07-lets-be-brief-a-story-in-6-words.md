<a href="http://middlezonemusings.com/all-contest-entries-lets-be-brief/">Write a story in 6 words </a>

Some of the better entries include; In between her smiles, despair danced, Kittens are harmless! (Sophie&quot;s last words.), Never was cutting toenails so fatal, 'wedding cake, kids, debt, divorce, freedom.'

In the end there where over 400 entries the <a href="http://middlezonemusings.com/stop-or-the-chicken-gets-it/">winners can be found on this page</a> and include ;
<ul>
	<li> Need publicity. Start contest. Six Words?</li>
	<li> "
Nice skin", he said, replacing it.</li>
	<li> Inability to complete thoughts continues to</li>
	<li>Trust. Things work out. Soon, please.</li>
	<li> Smoking, thinking about his lost passions.</li>
</ul>
I came much to late to enter the contest but I came up with a few of my own, 'Sam sunk deep in to his mind', 'I didn't eat the Nichole's mouse" ya I know they could use some work.

Interesting contest if nothing else
