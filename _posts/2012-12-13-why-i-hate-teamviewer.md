<strong>TeamViewer is a bad company do not pay for their software.Â </strong>

A year ago I found about a application called TeamViewer. It WAS this great utility that allowed me to support my friends andÂ collegesÂ with a remote desktop tool. After using it for free for 3 months I decided to do the right thing and purchase it. Big mistake.

The problems started when they updated the version to version 7. Only 2 months after I have purchased version 6.

Now every time I start TeamViewer I get aÂ warningÂ screen telling me that there is a new version of the application that I <strong>need</strong> to download. If I download the new version I get a ERROR message telling me my licence is not for this version and I can't use this application. So I have to downgrade to an older version of the application.

This wouldn't be such a problem but all of my family members that I support also get theÂ warningÂ message that they should upgrade to the newest version. When they upgrade to version 7 and I can no longer connect to them with my version 6. And since I can't run Version 7 on my computer because of the licencing issues I can't connect to them.

<strong>Since theÂ upgradeÂ to version 7, my version 6 application is useless.Â </strong>

The upgrade from version 6 to version 7 is $700 US, a new version is only $800, so not much savings at all.Â Version 6 of TeamViewer cost me ~$600 and was only useful for 2 months.<strong>Â </strong>

Now I am stuck in a very bad situation, I can't upgrade but when I ask a friend or family to download TeamViewer and give them a copy of the install for 6, they get a nag screen to upgrade their version and when they do I can't connect to them.

When I call TeamViewer toÂ complainÂ about this problem they give me a 10% off coupon forÂ the retail (not upgrade) version of the software. Â Useless.

If I never purchased their software I wouldn't have this problem as I couldÂ continentlyÂ use the software for free and upgrade as they release new versions. But because I was a good guy and purchased their software I am being punished.

<strong>TeamVeiwer is punishing me for doing the right thing and purchasing their software.Â </strong>

After doing some research I found that they release a new version of TeamViewer every 6-8 months forcing everyone to upgrade again. Forcing everyone that paid money for this application to pay again.

<strong>TeamViewer update cycle is there to force old customers to pay for the upgrades.Â </strong>

I will never buy another version of TeamViewer again and anyone I see using the application I will warn never to pay for it because of my badÂ experience.

I have since found <a href="https://join.me/">join.me</a> that is supported by <a href="https://secure.logmein.com">logmein</a>Â and made the switch with my family and friends.
