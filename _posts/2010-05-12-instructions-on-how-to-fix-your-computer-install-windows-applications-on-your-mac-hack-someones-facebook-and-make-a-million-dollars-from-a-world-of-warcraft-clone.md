Instructions on how to fix your computer, install windows applications on your mac, Hack someones Facebook, and make a million dollars from a World of warcraft clone.

Step 1. Get a fork... it should be about 4-6" long made of metal and not too sharp.
Step 2. Place in right hand with point end facing up. Ensure that you got a good grip on the handle.
Step 3: Bring right hand to face in a swift motion. You may encounter some resistance as the fork enters your face, that just means its working.
Step 5: Repeat until the desired results has occurred.
