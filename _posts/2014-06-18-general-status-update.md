Its been 6 months since I last updated this site. Lots have been going on here are the highlights.

<strong>Two factor authentication </strong>

I have been playing around with two factor authentication using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">google authenticator</a>. I was surprised to fine many of my daily used web apps all support this service and I have enabled it on as many web apps as I could and I have started to search for web apps that support Google Authenticator.

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/">Google authenticator is open source</a> and I was able to add I added it to a test server using the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/04/add-two-factor-authentication-to-your-website-with-google-authenticator-and-twilio-sms.html">this tutorials</a>. It was relatively easy and there appears to be lots of libraries to help make it even easier.
