The 13th Annual
MAD HATTERÂ¹S TEA PARTY

This year, the colourful characters of Lewis Carroll's beloved Alice in Wonderland come alive in three Vancouver parks, offering old-fashioned participatory fun for all.

Children of all ages are welcome to dress as their favourite character, bring a picnic, and join Alice as she meets Humpty Dumpty (before his Great Fall), has tea with the Mad Hatter, plays croquet with the King and Queen of Hearts, and dances the Lobster Quadrille to the fantastic troubadour sounds of Toot-A-Lute.

<strong>Where: When: </strong>
Saturday, July 22 - Burrardview Park (2600 block Wall St)
Saturday, July 29 - Renfrew Park (22nd &amp; Renfrew)
Sunday, July 30 - Trout Lake (east side of the lake)

All shows are noon to 3pm.

Join in the fun of one of Vancouver's truly most wonderful and imaginative family events!
