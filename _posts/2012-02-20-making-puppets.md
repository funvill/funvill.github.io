Me and a few friends made some simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet">sock puppets</a> at <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">Vancouver Hackspace</a> this week. We made them as a test before we try to make more complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets">Muppets</a> style puppets. I think they turned out really well for our first attempt.
