<a href="http://www.johnchow.com/" title="johnchow.jpg"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/05/johnchow.thumbnail.jpg" alt="johnchow.jpg" align="right" /></a>I recently reached the 200 mark in subscribed RSS feeds it was becoming unmanageable and I spent maybe 4 hours a day reading posts instead of making posts, not very productive.

Then I decided to clean out my subscription list and shrink it down to 10 feeds. It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be.  anyone that didn't post in the last 3 months... gone. Anyone that post more then 50 times a day... gone. Anyones that hasn't had an interesting post in 10 posts... gone. That left me with about 20 good solid feeds, it was very hard to get rid of the last 10 feeds but I was successful.

One of the feeds that I decided to keep was to <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/">John Chow blog</a>. I really enjoy reading about his late schema to <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/">make money online</a>.

A little while ago someone ordered a <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/seven-day-system-for-making-money-online-but-for-who/">review of their site</a> from his <a href="http://www.reviewme.com/">reviewme.com</a> account, it was an affiliates scam. Instead of being all nice and a good boy he exposed his entire plan for what it was... after that post I was hooked.

Hes also from my home town (Vancouver) or pretty close to. I hope to run in to him one day on the street and say 'hey I know you' shake his hand and go on my merry way.

The main reason that I am making this post that I am sure I will get flamed for later is that he has this contest thats going on right now. Make a post about him and link to a few key pages and he will link back from his rank 6 home page.  The reason that I waited so long to do a review of his site is that he is also almost at 100 site reviews, and I really want to be on that post, maybe I will get lucky.

To do a review of his site you have to post the following text in one of your posts.
<blockquote>John Chow <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/make-money-online-batch-77/#" id="KonaLink1" target="_top" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static"><font style="color: #005ebf ! important; font-family: verdana,tahoma" color="#005ebf"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #005ebf; color: #005ebf ! important; font-family: verdana,tahoma">dot </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #005ebf; color: #005ebf ! important; font-family: verdana,tahoma">Com</span></font></a> is blog that helps you <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/">make money online</a>.
