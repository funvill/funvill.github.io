<p align="left"><a href="/public/uploads/2007/03/usbcell.jpg" title="USB CELL"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/03/usbcell.jpg" alt="USB CELL" align="right" /></a>I hate buying batteries, I hate having to turn my house up side down looking for a fresh battery when I desperately need it. I will go out of my way to make sure that all my little gadgets have built in NiMH/NiCd Cells with adapters that I plug in each nigh.</p>
USBCELL are your standard NiMH 1.2v 1300mah AA batteries, but rechargeable via the USB port on your computer.  An interesting idea but it takes about 5 hours to charge it to 90%.

$18.59 US for a pair of two from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/USBCELL-AA-Rechargable-Battery-MXAA02/dp/B000LV8YKQ?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1174117139">Amazon </a>
