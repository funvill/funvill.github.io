This year for the <a href="http://vancouver.makerfaire.ca/">Vancouver Maker Faire</a> I build a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Compass-Table/">Compass table</a> that I found on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructables.com</a>. I found a cheap price on 1000x compasses from <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/">alibaba.com</a> for about $0.10 each. I found the wooden table at thrift store for $20 and two sheets of acrylic.

I made the square acrylic version first as a test to see how the table would look. Afterwards I constructed the table. The whole thing took about an hour.

Here is an image from Maker Faire with some kids playing with the table. I put the magnets in to some knex and attached strings to them so people would not walk off with them.

Finished and sitting in my living room
