Indian Dice is a poker game with dice.

I have played this game a few times, mainly when we don&quot;t have a set of cards to play with and want to play poker.  Its very simple if you have played poker before.

"
All the evidence shows that God was actually quite a gambler, and the universe is a great casino, where dice are thrown, and roulette wheels spin on every occasion.  Over a large number of bets, the odds even out and we can make predictions; that&quot;s why casino owners are so rich.  But over a very small number of rolls of the dice, the uncertainty principle is very important."
-Stephen Hawking

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>5 normal dice or 5 poker dice</li>
	<li>2 or more players.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play</strong>
The point of this game is to build the best poker hand after 2-3 rolls of 5 dice.  Each player in turn rolls the dice and keep the dice that they want to one side, then rolls 2-3 more times.  The player may stop after the first 2 or 3 rolls if they like.  The player with the highest ranking poker hand after everyone has had their turn wins.

Dice poker hands ranked high to low
1. Five of a Kind
2. Four of a Kind
3. Full House (3 of a kind and a pair K,K,K,J,J)
4. Straight (Five consecutive values. A, K, Q, J, 10)
5. Three of a Kind
6. Two Pairs
7. One Pair
8. Highest Die Ranking according to highest backers. (A, K, J, 10, 9. beats A, Q, J, 10, 9. )

You could use standard dice by simply playing 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 ,1 corresponding to A, K, Q, J, 10, 9.  Some versions of this game that use normal dice use 1 as a wild card that can be any value.
