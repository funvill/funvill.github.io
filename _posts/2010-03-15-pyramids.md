Pyramids is a drinking card game.

<strong>What you will need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A deck of cards</li>
	<li>2 or more players</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Each player is dealt four cards which they can look at, but shouldn&quot;t let other players see.  The dealer then deals out a pyramid of cards, one card at a time face up(diagram below).  If you a card that matches the card dealt face up, you can tell someone else to drink the number of times for the row in which the card was dealt.  However, considering this is a game of bullshitting and lying, you can even tell people to drink when you don&quot;t have that card.  But, if the person thinks you are lying, they can call your bluff  which doubles the drinking stakes.  If you are suspected of lying, you must show your card.  If you are caught lying, you drink double for the number of that is being dealt. Likewise, if you are not lying, the other person drinks double.

When you finish the pyramid, the game is over.
If you want to keep on going, simply bring the sixth row back down into another point.
