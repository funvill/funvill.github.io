## One Line Pitch

A macro pad keyboard with most commonly used Emoji as key caps for quick access when you want to respond to a message with an iconography.

## Description

<img src="/public/uploads/2023/top-16-emoji.png" alt="Top 16 Emoji" style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/>The macro pad could be any size with any number of keys but I found a 4x4 (16 keys) macro pad would work the best.

The macro pad can be application aware by using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). This would allow posts to have reactions when in Slack or Discord, and type the emoji while in any text application like email.

A full set of Emoji keycaps would be prohibitively expensive to ship. Instead I would let people select the keycaps that they want for the Emoji keyboard with some common packs. Like top 16, etc…

To create the key caps using [dye sublimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNZkzK4l0F8) techniques descriped in this video, or from this one from [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-scV7LLvdh8).

According to [Emojipedia stats](https://emojipedia.org/stats/) the 16 most popular Emoji are;
❤️ Red Heart, 🫶 Heart Hands, 😊 Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes, 🔥 Fire, ✨ Sparkles, 💀 Skull
😂 Face with Tears of Joy,, 🥹 Face Holding Back Tears, 👍 Thumbs Up, ✅ Check Mark Button,  🎉 Party Popper, ⭐ Star, 🥰 Smiling Face with Hearts, 😍 Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes, 😉 Winking Face, 💪 Flexed Biceps

I am sure that everyone has their own top 16 emoji that they use. Personally mine would be; 👍 Thumbs Up, ✅ Check Mark Button, ⭐ Star, 🎉 Party Popper, ❤️ Red Heart, 😍 Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes, 😊 Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes, 😉 Winking Face, 😭 Loudly Crying Face, 🤮 Face Vomiting, 💩 Pile of Poo, 💯 Hundred Points, 🔥 Fire, 💦 Sweat Droplets, 💪 Flexed Biceps, 🍆 Eggplant

- [Emoji Backlit Keycap Set - 61 keys with 6.25 Layout](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1326230451/emoji-backlit-keycap-set-61-keys-with) - Full keyboard set of 61 keys. You cannot select the ones that you want to use, but its pretty good selection.
- [An Emoji Keyboard Cover for Apple MacBooks and Apple Wireless Keyboards](https://laughingsquid.com/an-emoji-keyboard-cover-for-apple-macbooks-and-apple-wireless-keyboards/) - Plastic mat that goes over top of your MacBooks keyboard. The Emoji are full color but are sized too small and are ugly.
- [Emoji macropad for Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGPvuCFWLNg) - Not the standard emoji but instead little pads with clear tops that you can add your own images into
