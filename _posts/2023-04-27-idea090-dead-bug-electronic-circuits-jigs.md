## One Line Pitch

Create a series of 3D printed jigs for making exploded electronic circuits without PCBs

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\mohit-bhoite.png' alt='mohit-bhoite' title='mohit-bhoite' style="float: right; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px">I have always liked the look of “dead bug” (Free form circuits, point to point) electronic circuits. They take a lot of [patience and planning](https://www.hackster.io/jiripraus/led-jewelry-82430a) to create. A 3D printed jig helps a lot with the construction and angles of the parts. There are not a lot of good 3D printed jigs files available publicly.

Make a series of these “dead bug” electronic circuits each with a 3D printed jig to help with the construction. Publish tutorials to [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) to win contests.

- Timer that looks like an hourglass, that you flip to start. Sand hourglass. Button to change the time increments. Default 5 mins
- UV meter that detects sound and shows the sound levels with LEDs
- Solar powered, solar tracking flower that follows the sun to power itself.
