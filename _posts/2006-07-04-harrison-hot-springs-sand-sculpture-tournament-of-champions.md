The Harrison Hot Springs Sand Sculpture Society has invited former World Champions and multiple-medal winners from the past sixteen years of the World Championships of Sand Sculpture to compete as Doubles in the inaugural Tournament of Champions. These proven winners will submit their design for pre-formed blocks of sand by April and the Society will have them ready to carve when they arrive in Harrison Hot Springs in May.

All entries will start carving from the top down over the next thirty-six hours of competition. They will work eight-hour days on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday and finish at noon on Mothers&quot; Day.

Every visitor, attending the event between May 12 and June 30, 2006, will receive a ballot for them to choose their favourite sculpture.

These special Peoples&quot; Choice Awards are worth $3000 to the Champion, and $2500 to the runner-up. The third place winner will take home $2000. We expect between twenty and twenty-five entries overall. This is an absolutely unique First-in-the-World Event that you won&quot;t want to miss. Adults are only $6.00 with accompanied kids (5-13) only $3.00. Accompanied kids under five are FREE.

Their finished sculpture will remain on display until the end of the World Championships of Sand Sculpture Exhibition on October 09, 2006.
