After cutting the last batch of <a href="/acrylic-christmas-ornaments-version-1/">Acrylic Ornaments</a> I thought I would do a bit more research before doing the next run. Ideally I would like to write a program that would take a persons name and generate a unique snowflake for each person. While looking in to generative snow flakes I found a post on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch Snowflake</a>.
<blockquote>The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch star and Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry"

You can think of it as a additive fractal. Points are added to the system and the system gets more complex with each iteration. A quick google search found an source code for <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a> that would allow me to <a href="http://processing.org/learning/topics/koch.html">generate the Koch snowflake</a>. I altered the source code to output to a .PDF then edit the image in <a href="http://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a>.  There okay but still not what I am looking for.

I played around with it for a while but never got a design that I really liked.

Next I found a <a href="http://www.designlessbetter.com/project/snowflake/applet/snowflake.pde">script</a> that <a href="http://www.designlessbetter.com/blogless/posts/make-snowflake-designs-from-your-familys-names-regifted">generate snowflakes out of peoples names</a> also written in Proccessing. I played around with it for a while and generated a few different ones. They look interesting but still not what I am looking for.

<img class="size-full wp-image-3003 alignright" title="4620" src="/public/uploads/2012/11/4620.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="200" />Next I started looking in to paper craft snowflakes. I found this interesting design where two slits of paper with can be slotted in to each other to form a more 3 dimensional snow flake. I found this <a href="http://www.joannasheen.com/tuition-advice/christmas-baubles-by-sheila-weaver/">tutorial page</a> with a great example but no files to download.

I found another one on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">thingiverse</a> that is meant to be <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12034">3d printed</a>, but could easily be converted for the laser cutter.

There was also a few design files on thingiverse for laser cut snowflakes. One of the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5008">nicest ones</a> that I found on the site was a 4 piece one that snaps together. I will definitely be trying this design out next time I get a chance.

More research and testing needs to be done
