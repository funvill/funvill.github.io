After cutting the last batch ofÂ <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/acrylic-christmas-ornaments-version-1/">Acrylic Ornaments</a> I thought I would do a bit more research before doing the next run. Ideally I would like to write aÂ programÂ that would take a persons name and generate aÂ uniqueÂ snowflake for each person. While looking in to generative snow flakes I found a post on Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch Snowflake</a>.
<blockquote>The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch star and Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry"

You can think of it as aÂ additiveÂ fractal. Points are added to the system and the system gets moreÂ complexÂ with each iteration. A quick google search found an source code forÂ <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a>Â that would allow me to <a href="http://processing.org/learning/topics/koch.html">generate theÂ Koch snowflake</a>.Â I altered the source code to output to a .PDF then edit the image in <a href="http://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a>. Â There okay but still not what I am looking for.

<a style="color: #ff4b33; line-height: 24px;" href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/evilmadscientist.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3010 alignright" title="evilmadscientist" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/evilmadscientist-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Next I found another processing script by <a href="evilmadscientist.com">Evil Mad Scientist</a>Â specificallyÂ designed for <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/vector-snowflake-application/">making snowflakes for a laser cutter</a>. I played around with it for a while but never got a design that I really liked.

Next I found a <a href="http://www.designlessbetter.com/project/snowflake/applet/snowflake.pde">script</a> that <a href="http://www.designlessbetter.com/blogless/posts/make-snowflake-designs-from-your-familys-names-regifted">generate snowflakes out of peoples names</a>Â also written in Proccessing. I played around with it for a while and generated a few different ones. They look interesting but still not what I am looking for.

I found thisÂ interestingÂ design where two slits of paper with can be slotted in to each other to form a more 3Â dimensionalÂ snow flake. I found this <a href="http://www.joannasheen.com/tuition-advice/christmas-baubles-by-sheila-weaver/">tutorial page</a> with a great example but no files to download.

I found another one onÂ <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">thingiverse</a>Â that is meant to be <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12034">3d printed</a>, but could easily be converted for the laser cutter.

There was also a few design files on thingiverse for laser cut snowflakes. One of the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5008">nicest ones</a> that I found on the site was a 4Â piece one that snaps together. I will definitelyÂ be trying this design out next time I get a chance.

More research and testing needs to be done
