I made this <a href="/laser-cut-layered-circles/">laser cut, paper, layered, circle design</a> a few weeks ago. At the time I didn't have any different color paper so I made it out of red paper. The problem with making it all out of red is that the different layers don't show up that well. I took the results as a test and left it in the corner of my room where all my tests cut go.

I stumbled on to this <a href="http://charlesclary.wordpress.com/">Charles Clary</a> work with his layered paper cut sculptures. Below is a video of him creating one. Note how he uses spacers between each layer.

I took the old design and put a coroplast spacer between each layer just in the center and glued the entire set together. I like this version more than the old version as the layers are much more pronounced but basic design needs to be more interesting.
