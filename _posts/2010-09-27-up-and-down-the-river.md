Up and Down the River is a drinking game.

An excellent game with a potentially very high buzz factor.

<strong>What you Need to Play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>many people and at least two decks of cards</li>
</ul>
A good rule of thumb is one deck for six people, than an additional deck for every additional eight to ten people.

<strong>How to Play </strong>

Everyone sits in a circle.  One player is the dealer as well as a participant.  Each player is dealt four cards face up, to be kept in front of that player.  The dealer then starts €˜up the river€™ by turning over the first card, each player with the same card in front of him/her (suit doesn€™t matter), must take one drink.  If the person has more than one of the same card, it is a drink for each card.  The dealer then turns over the next card.  Same thing, except this time it is two drinks.  The next deal is three drinks, and the the last is four drinks.  After the fourth card, the dealer returns €˜down the river€™ by dealing the next card on top of the fourth card dealt.  Players with matching cards now GIVE four drinks away in any combination (four to one player, or maybe one drink to four different players). Same situation if the player has more than one of the same card (the player gives drinks for each card).  The dealer continues back €˜down the river€™ by dealing the next card on top of the third card dealt.  This time players give three cards for each matching card.  The next deal is a give of two drinks, and the last deal is a give of one drink.  After all the cards are dealt, simply shuffle and deal again.  Play continues until everyone is sick of the game, or sick from the beer.
