There are a lot of different POV projects out there that have influenced my project.

<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/n00tron-3D-Spherical-Display-Interactive-Exhibit/">n00tron 3D volumetric spherical display - interactive exhibit</a>
This is an interesting project. Instead of putting the LEDs on the outside of the ring they put them on the spokes of a bicycle rim. Then they spin the bicycle rim on 2 axes simultaneously creating a 3-dimensional Volumetric display. The display is pretty random but still really interesting to look at. What I like about this project is that they used a bicycle rim as their spinning center ring. I'm having problems sourcing a 6foot ring to use in the center of my project and if I end up scaling down the project I probably will use a bicycle rim like they do.

</a>I really like the mechanics of their set up, and they go thou the project set by set explaining all the problems that they had in the build as well. <a href="http://ytai-mer.blogspot.com/"></a>

I also wanted a way for people to build animations for this project beforehand. In <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burningman 2010</a> I saw this project <a href="http://cwd.co.uk/illuminatrix/">Illuminatrix</a> where they had a 16x16 pixel grid of RGB LEDs that people could program animations with <a href="http://cwd.co.uk/illuminatrix/edit.php">their editor</a>. The editor was written in JavaScript and hosted on their project's website for anyone to submit animations.
After I started this project I contacted Ben from the Illuminatrix project and asked him if I could use his idea for my own project. We sent a few very helpful emails back and forth and he agreed to help me build the animation editor. Woot! I'm so excited about this and I think it will add a lot to my project.

I also been looking at different DMX lighting controller to get an ideas on different settings that I could make available to the user to play with. Brass plates, big nobes, buttons, switches, sliders, gates, and other tactile feed back devices.
