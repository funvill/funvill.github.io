Vegetable is a word drinking game.

<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
The object of the game is to speak while hiding your teeth by curling your lips over them.  The game starts with each person choosing the name of a vegetable.  That will be their call name.  The first person to go will say their name twice then choose another person by saying their name twice.  That person will then continue by saying their name twice and "
calling" another person by saying their name twice.

<strong>Example</strong>
First Person:  Broccoli, Broccoli calls Asparagus, Asparagus
Second Person:  Asparagus, Asparagus calls Lettuce, Lettuce
Usually people feel, sound and look so ridiculous trying to say their names that everyone starts laughing - thus showing their teeth - resulting in a drink fest.  If you can laugh and still hide your teeth then you haven&quot;t had enough to drink beforehand.
