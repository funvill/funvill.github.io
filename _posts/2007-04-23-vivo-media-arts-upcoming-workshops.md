They also have a good variety of workshops on many different subjects.
Some of the upcoming workshops that have caught my eye;

<a href="http://videoinstudios.com/edu_index.php" aiotarget="false" aiotitle="Beginner electronics and circuit bending Thu. April 26, 6-9 PM, Fri. April 27, 6-9 PM (Two sessions x 3 hours)">Beginner electronics and circuit bending</a>
Thu. April 26, 6-9 PM, Fri. April 27, 6-9 PM (Two sessions x 3 hours)
<blockquote>This course will cover some basic theory of electronic principals that is essential for beginning to work with this medium. From there we will look at some of the components that make up simple circuits and that create the building blocks for more complex circuits. Students will learn some of the basic skills needed for electronic work such as soldering, breadboarding, and reading a schematic. These skills will be used to build <a href="/project-the-5-cracker-box-ipod-amplifier/">a simple audio amplifier</a> (simlare to the cracker box amp that i made earlier) and experiment with different input options such as contact microphones. We will also have a look at how to get started with circuit bending and modifying existing circuits.</blockquote>
<a href="http://videoinstudios.com/edu_index.php">Reverse animation and compositing</a>
Sat. April 28 2-6 PM
<blockquote>Reverse Animation is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscope">Rotoscoping</a>. Rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over live-action film movement, frame by frame, for use in animated films. Reverse Animation is the process in which you ERASE elements of live action or other media, using Photoshop, creating transparent backgrounds or other effects. These frames can then be used in Final Cut Pro to create professional looking multi-layer compositions.</blockquote>
<a href="http://videoinstudios.com/edu_index.php">Digital photography</a>
Thu. May 10, 6-9:30 PM, Fri. May 11, 6-9:30 PM (Two sessions x 3.5 hours)
<blockquote>The irony of digital photography is that it is now so easy and convenient to take good pictures, yet people are too overwhelmed by these advances to take advantage of them. In this workshop participants will learn how to manipulate ISO settings (sensitivity of "film"), when to use spot metering or regular metering, how to use aparture priority and shutter priority, how to set white balance, and how to do post processing. The workshop will be hands-on, with an extensive question and answer session.</blockquote>
<a href="http://vivomediaarts.com/">VIVO Media arts</a> has lots of other workshops available and new ones are added regularly, if you get a chance you should check them out.
