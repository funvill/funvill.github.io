It's been another unusual year with the continued [global COVID pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19), more eventful than 2021 with more things opening up and allowing us to travel more.

## Housing

April 2022 was a big month for me as my partner, Lori, moved in with me to the townhouse. This was a big change for Lori, as she had been living in her previous place for ~18 years. Adjusting to life in Burnaby has been a bit of a challenge, as she went from being surrounded by 30 independent coffee shops within 20 blocks in [Mount Pleasant](https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/mount-pleasant.aspx) to just 7 coffee shops, 5 of which are Starbucks.

Additionally moving into a neighborhood with mostly families as a working professional has been challenging. We are finding it difficult to relate to our neighbors that chase after their kids all day and their greatest goal is to have a couple extra hours of sleep each night. It's been a bit of an adjustment trying to find common ground with our neighbors and build relationships in this new community.

To make our townhouse feel more like home, we decided to give it a fresh coat of paint. We went with a light blue for the majority of the interior, with a bold red kitchen. We also added some colorful wallpaper to the bathrooms to give them some personality. We started hanging art on the walls covering 60% of the wallspace.

While our townhouse suits our needs for now, I don't expect it to be our forever home. For now, we're happy to be making this space our own.

## Cherry blossoms

Right outside of our front door, there is a beautiful cherry blossom garden that exploded with pretty blossoms at the end of February. We were able to get some great photos of the blossoms and it seemed like hundreds of other people were doing the same, taking photos and doing photo shoots. We saw all sorts of interesting sights, like a pug picnic with party hats, snowboarders in full gear doing action shots with the petals, full wedding parties, a gender reveal party, and even people with oversized anime heads in kimonos. It was a wild few weeks of people-watching and I was thoroughly entertained by all the creative ways that people were using the cherry blossoms as a backdrop.

## CBC interview and Bird playing card project

This year, we had the opportunity to be interviewed by [Gloria Macarenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Macarenko) on CBC for our [Vancouver Bird playing card project (2021)](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2021-bird-playing-cards/). It was a great experience, but watching the video back is a bit cringeworthy for me, as I'm much quieter and more reserved than I normally am and I never once look at the camera. Lori, on the other hand, did an amazing job and really saved the interview.

Overall, it was a good experience, but it's definitely intimidating to be on camera. It's not something I'm used to, but it's always good to push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new things.

You can watch our interview on CBC website here: [https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2011632707940](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2011632707940)

## Birding

After birding for most of 2021 and the first half of 2022, we finally had the chance to see our first owl this year while hiking in Burnaby Mountain. It stuck around for about 15 minutes, which gave us plenty of time to photograph it before it flew off. While the lighting wasn't great, I was able to get some decent shots.

A fledgling crow landed on our back patio for three days until it was strong enough to fly away. It was cute to see the baby crow but it made such a ruckus and a giant mess.

While we enjoyed birding this year, we didn't do it as much as we did in 2021. We only went bird watching about a dozen times this year, as we were busy with other projects and didn't make as much time for it. I think having a project centered around this hobby really helped push us to get outdoors and do more birding in 2021. Don't get me wrong, I still love birding, but it wasn't our default activity for every spare moment like it was in 2021.

## Travel

As things began to open up more this year, I was able to travel a bit more, which was a welcome change. My first trip was a combination of business and pleasure, as I was sent to Florida for the [BACnet Plugfest](https://bacnetplugfest.org/) by my company, and then traveled to Mexico for a vacation. In preparation for that trip I worked too hard to get everything ready. By the time the conference came around I was exhausted and wasn’t thinking clearly.

While the conference in Florida went well, I made a few trip planning mistakes and ended up spending a few extra days in Florida before heading to Mexico. The first few days in Mexico were a bit of a blur as I started to unwind and relax, spending most of my time watching the waves and enjoying a few cervezas. I met up with a co-worker in his home town of [Holbox](https://en-holbox.com/) and he showed me around. Lori joined me after a week and we had a fantastic time exploring the city of [Playa Del Carmen](https://www.playadelcarmen.com/), going diving in [Isla Mujeres](https://www.islandlifemexico.com/isla-mujeres-guide/), experiencing the [bioluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence) on Holbox, bird watching and snorkeling in [Yalahau](https://en-holbox.com/yalahau/), and visiting Isla de la Pasión. Overall, it was a great trip and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have traveled a bit more this year.

Our next big adventure was a wonderful road trip through the Okanagan and interior of British Columbia. We visited wineries in Kelowna, went floating down the river in Penticton, experienced a murder mystery on the [Kettle Valley Steam Railway](https://www.kettlevalleyrail.org/), visited more wineries in Osoyoos, attended the [Greenwood](https://www.greenwoodcity.com/) Founders Day, relaxed at the [Ainsworth Hot Springs](https://www.ainsworthhotsprings.com/), and made our way all the way up to Kaslo, BC and back through [Manning Park](https://www.manningpark.com/).

One highlight of the trip was being able to stop by my mother's home in [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda,_British_Columbia) and visit with her during the Greenwood Founders Day. The mayor even gave us a tour of the old prison courthouse.

British Columbia is really beautiful during the summer, and I always forget how much beauty there is in my own backyard when I'm traveling all around the world. It was great to be able to explore more of my own province and appreciate all it has to offer.

In November, I had the opportunity to travel to [Del Mar, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Mar,_California) for work to see one of our customers and meet the people I've been working with remotely throughout the year. After that, I traveled to Pasadena for the [HackADay Superconference](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/12/the-2022-supercon-badge-is-a-handheld-trip-through-computing-history/), which was a fantastic three-day event filled with interesting talks about hardware and software, as well as some amazing after-hour parties and hardware hacking. One of the highlights of the conference was the Super Conference conference badge, which was a retro 4-bit computer that you could hand program in binary using buttons on the front of the badge.

After the conference, a friend and I spent a few days exploring Los Angeles, hiking in the Santa Monica Mountains, visiting the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the [California Science Center](https://californiasciencecenter.org/), [The Getty](https://www.getty.edu/), [The Broad](https://www.thebroad.org/), [the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles](https://www.moca.org/visit/grand-ave), [Apex Electronics](https://apexsurplus.com/#!), and spending time at [Venice Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Los_Angeles) and the [Santa Monica Pier](https://www.santamonicapier.org/).

While hiking in the Santa Monica Mountains, we were surprised to see a mansion with a giant anti-robot on the side of the hill. We both instantly recognized it as [EatArt's Prosthesis](https://eatart.org/gogo/prosthesis-the-anti-robot/), which we had both seen being built in Vancouver over the past 10 years. It was a strange coincidence to see it in the mountains of Santa Monica.

We also went to Shuswap for Canada day, Point Roberts for the first time, Bowen Island - [Kitoki Inn](https://kitoki-inn.com/), [Camp Fircom](https://www.fircom.ca/) for a wedding, and [Lake Cheakamus](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/helm-lake/).

## Fostering Noodles the Puppy

In September, Lori and I decided to foster a puppy for a few weeks. We have always wanted a pet, but our previous houses were not suitable to have one. We were hesitant to get a pet for the long term as we aren't sure how long we'll be at our current place and the next place might not allow pets. Additionally, we like to travel a lot and having a puppy would complicate things. However, we still wanted to experience the joy of having a pet, so we decided to foster instead.

Our first foster puppy was Noodles, and he couldn't have come at a better time. We both ended up getting COVID and all Noodles wanted to do was snuggle with us on the hammock for the first two weeks. When you're sick and the world feels like a stupid horrible place, a cute snuggle puppy can make everything seem a little more bearable and help time pass more quickly.

To our surprise, I really enjoyed the responsibility of caring for something beyond myself. I enjoyed getting up 2-3 times a night to let Noodles out to pee, taking him for walks and getting to know our neighbors (or at least their kids), and having a reason to go for a walk each day. It was a very hard and emotional time when Noodles got adopted and we had to give him up. We had all the logical reasons for why we couldn't keep him, but that didn't make it any easier to say goodbye. I don’t know if we'll have the emotional strength to foster again.

## Projects

### Flocking AI / Ai Art

Flocking AI is a project where I am using Artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to generate a “Field guide of imaginary birds”.

The short version of how it works is: I created a chatbot using Open IA GPT-3 and filled it with as much bird information as I can, bird ID books, bird encyclopedias, and bird joke books. Then I have a  conversation with this ‘bird nerd chat bot’ to generate a bio for an imaginary bird. I take this bio and use it as the seed text for a text-to-image generator called Mid Journey. Then I post a new imaginary bird to social media each day. Each bird has its own unique bio and image all created by AI.

I had the opportunity to show off the first four months of images from this project at the Vancouver Cultural Crawl at Maker Labs, and it was a great experience to be able to share it with the public and get some feedback on the direction I should take the project next.

I'm still not entirely sure how I feel ethically about this project, but the work is done, the project is pretty much automated at this point. I'm planning on continuing it for a full year and see how I feel afterwards.

You can read more about this project on the [Flocking AI project page](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2022-flocking-ai/). I also wrote a [post mortem](https://blog.abluestar.com/flockingai-eastside-culture-crawl-2022-post-mortem/) from the Cultural Crawl event

### Habit tracker

This year, I had the opportunity to learn how to design PCB boards with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), thanks to a friend who gave me a tutorial on how to get the parts placed and manufactured. This is a skill that I've been wanting to learn for a few years now, as it opens up a lot of new opportunities to build specific electronics for projects.

As a first learning project, I created a single month habit tracker inspired by [Simone Giertz's "The Every Day Calendar"](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar). This habit tracker allows me to track multiple activities each day, and when I complete a habit that I want to track, I simply press a button and the light illuminates to show that I've completed the task.

## What’s next for 2023?

One of my goals for 2023 is to make six more electronics projects, and now that I've learned how to design PCB boards with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/0), I'm excited to see what I can create. This skill will definitely come in handy as I work on new projects and try to push my limits as a maker.

I have a few trips planned at the beginning of the year, and I would like to do a big trip outside of North America for my 40th birthday.

## Movies and TV reviews
