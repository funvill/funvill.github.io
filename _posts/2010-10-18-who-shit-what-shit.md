Who Shit, What Shit is a drinking game.

<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
Everyone in the game gets a name which ends with shit (i.e.  Batshit, Dogshit, Horseshit, Jalepenoshit) and all you have to do is remember the other persons name.

The drinking game starts when someone starts to tell a long winded story that includes the word shit several times.
"
I was walking through the woods and it was some crazy shit, absolutely wild shit, i might have even been smoking shit, etc€¦"

Usually the crowd eggs the person on.  Then the storyteller will work in one of the group members names (eg. batshit) at which time the person has to say:
Player:  Who shit?
Storyteller:  What shit?
Player:  "player's name..(e.g. batshit)
This goes on until someone makes a mistake at which time the person who messed up has to drink and then start his own story.
