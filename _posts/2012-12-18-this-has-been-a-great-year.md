This has been a great year!
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">Removed stressful people from my life, simplifying my life considerably. </span></li>
	<li>My girlfriend has moved in with me, helping me to become a better person, with my heath and generally motivating me to become all I can be.</li>
	<li>Making new friends and surrounding myself with positive people that do wonderful things.</li>
	<li>Started taking on smaller more attainable projects and completing them.</li>
	<li>I have built so many interesting things over the past year with the help of VHS.</li>
	<li>Been looking in to <em>buying</em> my first place, hopefully somewhere in the city limits.</li>
	<li>I'm on the board of directors for 3 Orgs, trying to make the city a better place.</li>
	<li>I learned a lot about how to run large groups with the help of <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/">Vancouver Hackspac</a>e (VHS). VHS now has ~110 members.</li>
	<li>I learned a lot about how to run large events like MakerFaire and I am looking forward to <a href="http://makerfaire.ca/">Maker Faire Vancouver 2013</a>.</li>
	<li>Zee has started <a href="http://makermobile.org/">makermobile.org</a> and looks to be an amazing project.</li>
</ul>
