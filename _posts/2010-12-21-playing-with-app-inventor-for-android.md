I looked in to it hoping I could create a simple <a href="http://www.everydayfiction.com/">EveryDayFiction</a> feed reader app but it doesn't seem to support <em>Get RSS feed</em> just yet.

So I created a simple sensor reading app that reads all the sensors on the phone and displays them raw to the users. (Note the sensors are all zero because its running in emulation)

The App inventor is a pretty simple programing IDE, it would work great for kits as its simple enough for them to understand and it gets stuff to the screen fast.

A few missing features that i was wishing for while building this app.
<ul>
	<li>Html panel designer - I can do a lot with simple HTML much more then i could with their GUI designer.</li>
	<li>RSS feeds - I really want to get content from 3rd party websites to build social web apps.</li>
	<li>File IO - This might be a bit beyond the scope of this project but I want a away to save the results of this output to a text file for future review. I know they have the SQLiteDB but its not saved as plain text and needs a special application to actually view it.</li>
</ul>
Interesting idea, but I don't see to many people making killer apps with this software.
