High is a dice game.
The simplest of all the dice games I know.  If you know of a simpler game please tell me, I would be interested to know.
The game can be played for stakes where the player with the highest roll wins the post.

<strong>What do you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 dice</li>
	<li>2 or more people</li>
</ul>
<strong>Object of the game</strong>
Roll the highest with two dice.

<strong>How to play</strong>
Each of the players take turns rolling both dice, the player with the highest score of the two dice wins.  If there is a tie a private sub-game is played.
