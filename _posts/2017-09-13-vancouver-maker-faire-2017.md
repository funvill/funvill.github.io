This year for the vancouver maker faire I decided to show off some my LED and lighting projects that I had created over the past few years. I also created a special project just for Vancouver Maker Faire the LED Pillar.

## LED Pillar

The LED Pillar project is thought experiment of how to make a game with a single strip of LEDs as the display. After a few different iterations the final game resembles popular [Guitar Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero) game from 2005 on a single LED strip.

The object of this game is to score as many points as possible by pressing the corresponding colored button as a “beat” enters the goal area. If a beat leaves the goal area or the user presses the wrong colored button, they lose a life. The user starts with 5 lives. As the game progresses the speed of the “beats” increases.

## Laser kaleidoscope

A circular light box that incorporates moving lasers which generate twisting fractal shapes. 16 servos are evenly placed around the circle. Each servo has a laser diode on it, with a vertical fresnel len creating a line. The servos will rotate creating patterns inspired by mathematical formulas, cardioids and fractals. This project is based on a video called “Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics” by “Burkard Polster” also known as “Mathologer”.

## Thunderstorm cloud

The Thunderstorm cloud project is an interactive lamp that mimics thunderstorm cloud. Utilizing a strip of LEDS, some sensors, and a Arduino. It is cable of creating a unique lighting storm based on its surroundings. No two thunderstorms are the same. A 60 cm wide 40 cm tall made of pillow fluff and chicken wire.

## Hippy ball of life
This project was to create a marker that other people could use to find me in a crowd at a festivals. The ball itself is a 20 sided icosahedron with the flower of life pattern on each panel. Each panel is illuminated with a series of addressable LEDs. The LEDs patterns and color change with the movement of the ball.
