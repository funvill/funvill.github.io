I have always been fascinated by theÂ Chinese paper cut pictures. The owl image below came from a scan of a paper cut picture that I picked up while in china. I started researching how these chinese paper drawings where made and found that many of them come from silhouette drawings that are converted into paper cut drawings afterward. I searched google and found a bunch of other silhouettes and started to convert them to vectors so I could cut them on the laser cutter. I think the branches one turned out the best.
