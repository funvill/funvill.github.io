Today I was told by a friend of mine of a game that recently started in Vancouver called <a href="http://www.manhunt-vancouver.com/">Manhunt</a>.
<blockquote><strong>BASIC MANHUNT RULES:</strong>
Manhunt is a hide-and-seek variant. The game starts out with one person, known as the MANHUNTER, who is €œit€. After the manhunter has been selected, the FUGITIVES have 120 seconds to hide.

If a FUGITIVE is tagged by a MANHUNTER, she or he is BRAINWASHED and forced to join the side of the MANHUNTERS. At the end of the designated time limit, all FUGITIVES who have not been arrested are declared the winners.

Play occurs within predetermined boundaries. If a FUGITIVE exits these boundaries for any reason, she/he joins the MANHUNTERS. Players are identified as being distinct from the general civilian population by means of a HIGHLY-VISIBLE ARMBAND.</blockquote>
Sounds like an interesting game.

The next match is WEDNESDAY April 25th 2007 @ 7:30 &amp; 8:45 pm @ Waterfront Station. I'm going to see if i can convince a few of my friends to join me its always better with more people.
You can find out more about this game from the <a href="http://www.manhunt-vancouver.com/">official Vancouver manhunt site</a>.
