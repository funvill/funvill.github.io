<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping">Ping</a></strong>: A call out in to the void in search of another. To check the existence of life on the other end. To seek a connection. A normal response to ping is "pong"

<strong>Pong</strong> in answer to a ping: Yes, I do exist. I acknowledge your existence and you are no longer alone in this system. We have a connection and I am waiting for you.

Its a beautiful system.
