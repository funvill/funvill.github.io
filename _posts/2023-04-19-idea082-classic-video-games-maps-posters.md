## One Line Pitch

A poster of level maps for classic 80s and 90s video games, nostalgia

## Description

Create a poster of the maps of levels from classic 80s and 90s video games.

For example:

- [Mario brothers 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3) - Each level could be stacked on top of each other as most of them are a flat plane. Because there are so many levels, maybe just the first world or a selection of 10 most iconic levels from across all the worlds. [Sprite map](https://www.nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers3/SuperMarioBrothers3.html)
- [Super Mario Kart](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Kart) - The race course outlines simple line drawings from above. Tiled across the poster. This could be super minimalistic without any labels.
- [Doom](https://www.classicdoom.com/doommaps.htm) - Same as Mario Kart with line drawings for each map, titled across the poster. Minimalistic with no labels. If you know then you know.
- [The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) - The [world map](https://mikesrpgcenter.com/zelda3/maps.html) is an easy poster.
- [Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger) - The world map across the ages. One map for each age. 65 Million BC, 12,000 BC, 600 AD, 1000 AD (altered, and unaltered), 1999 AD, 2300 AD.. For the postere I would make a circle of these different world maps. 
- [Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid) - An overly complex world map of the entire game. Lots of color and very intricate.
- Others: [Mega Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man), [DuckTales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales),

Different styles

- I like the minimalist versions of the world maps. Just enough so that people who have played the game would recognize it while others would see it as a bunch of squiggly lines. If you know then you know, Secret knowledge, ingroup
- Overwhelming detail. Some of the games have huge maps, filling a poster where each level only takes up an inch or more to show how large the game truly is.

## Prior art

- [NES Maps](https://www.nesmaps.com/) - They used Emplators to take screenshots and replicate the maps. They have a shop where they [sell posters](https://shop.nesmaps.com/). The posters are true to the source material but aren't interesting.
- [Nintendo power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power) magazines and strategy guides
- [Doom maps pen plotter](https://twitter.com/liviopacifico/status/1396540463432146944)
- [Doom maps laser cut](https://theor.xyz/doom-maps-laser-cut/) - [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35578765)

## Market

Man caves, and people who live for nostalgia. I would probably get sued if I tried to make and sell these.
