Indian Poker is a drinking, card game.
I just played this game for the first time this weekend.  It was very simple to learn and really good after a few beers.  It's a pretty silly game and if you are in the right mood it can really make you laugh.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A deck of cards</li>
	<li>2 or more players</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Everyone is dealt one card face down so no one can see the cards.  Each player licks the back of the card and sticks it to their forehead.  You should be able to see all the other players cards, but you should not be able to see your own.  Starting with the dealer each person bets with number of drinks if they think they have the highest card or they fold.  If a player folds they have to drink as many drinks as the highest bet.  (I suggest that you put a 5 drink max bet to be reasonable).  Once everyone has called or folded, everyone reveals their cards to each other and whoever has the highest card does not have to drink.

If there is a tie, a private match between the players is held.  Aces are high.
