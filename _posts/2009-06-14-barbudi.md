Barbudi is commonly found in many Mexican casinos and clubs but probably originated in middle east. When the game is played in a casino the dealer takes a small percentage of the winnings because the game is evenly matched. It can be played by any number of people but only two people at a time. Most of the time it is played with a dice cup.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
Two or more players, but only two people can play at a time.
Two Dice
A dice cup (optional)

<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Each player rolls a dice the player with the highest roll becomes the shooter.  The player on the shooter's right becomes the fader.  Play rotates counter-clockwise.
The fader places a bet up to the agreed limit that the shooter will lose on his roll, the bet is placed in the center of the table.
The fader has the choice to pass the dice to the left if he does not want to bet against the shooter.
The shooter may place an equal amount to the sum in the center or less, if he puts up less then the other players may cover the extra amount. The shooter may also pass and give the dice to the player on his right.
The other players may place side bets if they like.
The shooter and fader roll the dice alternately, the shooter rolling first. Either of the two players wins the bet if they throw a 3-3, 5-5, 6-6, or 5-6. They lose if they throw 1-1, 2-2, 4-4 or 1-2. All other combinations are meaningless.
As long as the shooter wins, loses with a 1-2, or the fader wins with a 5-6 the player&quot;s roles remain unchanged for the next round. Otherwise the fader becomes the shooter and the next player the new fader.
