The flower plug was designed to allow the user to know when the bath water was just the right temperature by changing color from a light pink to a beautiful deep purple color. Once the flower is purple, it is safe to enter the water without the fear of it being too hot.

You probably will not be able to find these down at your local wal mart or bathroom accessory store. I searched for the designers website but came up empty handed. if you know where i can buy one of these, leave me a comment.
