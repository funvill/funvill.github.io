<p align="left">They don't want to set up a feed reader , they can seem to understand that it could save them time in the long run and helps them organize all the blogs and news groups that they they read.</p>
<p align="left">Checking 35 websites every day just in case something new has been posted seems ridiculous to me but its a way of life for many others.</p>
This is why websites like  <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">rssfwd.com</a> and <a href="http://squeet.com/">squeet.com</a> where invented. They resolve this problem by allowing you to set up a email subscription to any RSS feed. Any updates to the RSS feed will apear in your inbox.

You can subscribe to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=761260">abluestar.com's email subscription</a> list that will send you an email every time a new post is added.

Or if you use a feed reader you can subscribe to our <a href="feed:http//feeds.feedburner.com/Abluestar">rss feed</a>
