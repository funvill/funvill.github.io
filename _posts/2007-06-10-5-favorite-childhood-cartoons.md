<a href="http://www.msdanielle.com/"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/06/250px-talespin.gif" alt="250px-talespin.gif" align="right" />Ms. Danielle</a> is giving away a <a href="http://www.msdanielle.com/microsoft-zune-30gb-giveaway-contest">30GB Microsoft Zune</a> that she won from John Chow. In her contest you have to talk about her <a href="http://www.msdanielle.com/">new blog site</a> and link to at lest one post.

I checked out her site and found a interesting post right away <a href="http://www.msdanielle.com/my-top-5-favorite-childhood-cartoons/">my-top-5-favorite-childhood-cartoons</a> and I decided to write my own top five.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_(MGM)"><strong>Tom &amp; Jerry</strong></a>  - Its the only one that I agree with that was on <a href="http://www.msdanielle.com/">Ms. Danielle</a> list. it was one of my favorite shows as a kid but it was on super early in the morning, 7am if I remember correctly. So I didn't get to see much of it till my family bought a VCR and we where able to recored it. In my early 20s when I was a downloading pirate I downloaded the complete collection it took 2 months to watch it all.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a> </strong>- An instance favorite and will always have a soft spot for me. My favorite characters was Montana Max, and Elmyra Duff.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales">DuckTales</a></strong> - The miss adventures of a bunch of ducks, I still remember many of the different episodes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain"><strong>Pinky and the Brain</strong></a> - As a kid that wanted to grow up to be a mad scientist and take over the world this show was a perfect fit.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkwing_Duck"><strong>Darkwing duck</strong></a> - To this day i still hmm the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=czCqMWRFVg4">opening title sequence</a>. When I was a kid I use to draw all the characters from this show. I got pretty good at coping because of it.</li>
</ul>
One more because I watched way too much television as a child.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaleSpin">TaleSpin </a>-  The Jungle Book charters delivering packages, a golden idea with 65 epps.</li>
</ul>
They just don't make cartoons like this any more.
