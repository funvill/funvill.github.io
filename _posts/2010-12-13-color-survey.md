Color is subjective and people see colors differently sometimes wildly differently. Where someone sees the color red a different person will see orange or yellow. This survey is designed to find a common ground for defining color names.

I didn't some up with this test, it was stolen directly from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Patrick Munroe</a> (<a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>) and he deserves all the credit. After two weeks of running this test he stopped accepting new submissions and <a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">displayed his results</a>. I am looking to do a longer study of color and how color changes over the years.
