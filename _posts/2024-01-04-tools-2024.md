This page is inspired by [UsesThis.com](https://usesthis.com/) - _A collection of interviews asking people from all walks of life, what they use to get the job done_.

A series of snapshots of the tools and equipment that I use over the years. Previous snapshots of my tools and equipment lists can be found here: [2022](/tools-2022/), [2021](/current-tools-and-equipment-2021), [2018](/tools-2018), [2016](/tools-2016)

## Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is __[Steven Smethurst](/about)__ and live two lives. During the day I am a CTO at [Chipkin Automation Systems](http://store.chipkin.com/) and at night I am a maker, hacker and artist. You can find more about me and my projects on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/funvill) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/funvill).

## What has changed since 2022

Since ditching Netflix, and other streaming services in 2022. I have moved to using [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) to stream media from my [Synology DiskStation DS923+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS923+) to the devices in my house.

I have taken the effort to switch most of my note taking, todo lists, and journaling to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I built a custom ChatGPT chatbot to help with daily journaling prompts ([Idea #30 chatbot-journaling](https://blog.abluestar.com/idea030-chatbot-journaling/))

I been doing more hardware devlopment over the past few years. To help with diagnose and debug the hardware I got a [Saleae Logic 8](https://www.saleae.com/). One of the best logic analyzers that I have ever used.

I picked up a [Anbernic RG35xx plus](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-plus) to play reto games on the bus or airplanes. Its good, but the size cramps my hands after a few hours.

One of my goals in 2022 was to become more mobile. Following the paths of the [digital nomad](https://nomadlist.com/) to escape Vancouver's winters. To help with this goal I got a [Lenovo Yoga 9i (14‚Äù Intel)](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/yoga-9i-gen-8-(14-inch-intel)/83b1001yus).
