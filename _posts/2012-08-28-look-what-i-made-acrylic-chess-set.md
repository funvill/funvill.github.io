I made a Acrylic chess set at <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">Vancouver Hackspace</a> (VHS) on their new laser cuter. The design files came from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6593">thingiverse</a>.

This is the first thing that I have ever made with a Laser cuter. It was a great learning experience and I hope to move on to <a href="/two-layer-stencils/">stencils</a> next.

Normally a stencil would take me upwards of two to three hours to complete depending on how many colors and the complexity. With the laser cuter it shouldn't take me longer then a few mins.
