Sequences is a dice game.
This game is a version of an old game called 'Hearts' or 'Hearts Due' that is played with a special set of dice that have the letters H, E, A, R, T, S printed on their sides instead of numbers.

This game is also known as 'Straight Shooter', 'Hearts' or 'Hearts Due'.

<strong>What You Need to Play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>6 dice</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Object of the Game</strong>
To be the first player to reach 100 points.

<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
Each player in turn rolls the six dice and scores points for any sequence of consecutive numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6) thrown beginning with 1.  If two or more of the same number are rolled only one counts (1,2,2,3,4,2 = 20 points).  If a player rolls the dice and three 1s show their score is zero and they pass the dice to the next player.
1 = 5 points
1, 2 = 10 points
1, 2, 3 = 15 points
1, 2, 3, 4 = 20 points
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = 25 points
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 = 35 points
1, 1, 1 = Players turn is over

<strong>Variations of the Game</strong>
Some people play without the three 1s rule.  Some people  play where six 6s is worth 70 points.
