<blockquote>"Next to jazz music, there is nothing that lifts the spirit and strengthens the soul more than a good bowl of chili. Congress should pass a law making it mandatory for all restaurants serving chili to follow a Texas recipe."

The thought that beans do not belong in chili may be further credited to the fact that most "
official" chili cook-offs do not allow beans. In many cases a chili will be disqualified if it contains such ingredients considered "
filler". <a href="http://www.chili.org/documents/CASI%20Official%20Rule%20Book.pdf">Article I, A, 2</a> of the <a href="http://www.chili.org/">CASI </a>rules states: "2. NO FILLERS IN CHILI - Beans, macaroni, rice, hominy, or other similar ingredients are not permitted."

Anyone that has ever been to a real chili cook off knows that real chili tastes nothing like the stuff that you can get in a can from the grocery store. Its missing the bite, that you can really only get with good home made chili.

Chili should also be stored in the fridge over night before its ready to eat. Some say it seals in the flavor.  I tend to use a slow cooker to cook it over 48+ hours to create a really nice roasted flavor.
