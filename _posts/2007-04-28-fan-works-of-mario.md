Mario and his friends will always have a special spot in our hearts.

Because there are so many fans of Mario and his friends after a while fan art, fan movies, fan flash animations start to pop up.

Here is a collection of a few of the better ones

Most fans tend to make Mario out to be a bad buy, I wonder why?

If you have anther Mario contributed work feel free to comment with it and I will add it to the list.
