# TV and Movies

Netflix lost me as a customer after they started [blocking password sharing](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-password-sharing-1.6741484) in February 2023. Since then I mostly pirate movies and TV shows using my Plex server. Two years later and I am still salty about this.

I have not been great at updating my [My Letter BoxD](https://letterboxd.com/funvill/films/by/entry-rating/size/large/) profile. I expect that I will update it once a year when making this year end post.

## Where did this data come from

- Plex server sorted by date
- Prime video
- Cineplex ticket history

## Ranking

- (Great) - I would recommend
- (Good) - Its okay it has issues
- (Meh) - Forgettable, don't bother
- (Bad) - Horrible do not watch

## Movies I watched in the theaters üçø

- Great - [Deadpool & Wolverine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/) - Great movie, move of the year.
- Great - [Dune: Part Two](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/)
- Good - [Heretic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28015403/) - I left the theater not liking this movie but over the week afterwards it grew on me. I didn't care for the ending, felt rushed.
- Good - [Joker: Folie √† Deux](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11315808/) - I really liked the first one, a mixture of what is real and what is made up in his head. This one didn't have the magic of the first movie but was still pretty good.
- Good - [Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12037194/) - I liked it, some of the weird actor choices and acting choices brought me out of the theme but otherwise it was fun
- Meh - [The Beekeeper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15314262) - Generic, predictable story. Exactly what you expect from Jason Statham
- Bad - [Borderlands](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4978420/) - This movie was cut up into slivers of shots and spliced back together. Couldn't follow the movie at all. Just Terrible

## Movies I watched at home üì∫

- Great - [Saltburn](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17351924/) (2023) - I loved it. It was recommended to me by a friend and I went into it without knowing anything about it.  
- Great - [The Fabelmans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14208870/) (2022) - Beautifully shot, well directed, exactly what I expect from [Steven Spielberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/)
- Great - [Nimona](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19500164/) (2023) - I wasn't expecting much coming into this movie but the story was amazing and the animation and jokes were great. Great surprise
- Great - [The Godfather](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) (1972), [The Godfather Part 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/) (1974), [The Godfather Part 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/) (1990) - I watched all three of these movies back to back, extended directors cut versions. Wonderful. The shift in part three was a little jarring but still great.
- Great - [Goodfellas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/) (1990) - I watched this and Scarface after watching The Godfather. It was a nice shift in tone. Since this film [Joe Pesci](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000582/?ref_=tt_cst_t_3) basically plays this character in all his subsequent rolls.
- Great - [Dream Scenario](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21942866) (2023) - I loved this premise, brilliant. The show in all its parts are exactly what I was looking for. It did feel like the editing could have been better but otherwise great movie.
- Great - [Civil War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17279496/) (2024) - Very different then what I was expecting going into this movie. Wonderful, Cinematography was top notch.
- Good - [Red One](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14948432/) - I was expecting Christmas slop, and it definitely had feelings of that but it was surprisingly good.  
- Good - [My Old Ass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18559464) - I watched this because it had [Aubrey Plaza](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2201555/) in it. It was okay coming to age story. Enjoyable.
- Good - [Bee Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389790/) - I am almost two decades late in watching this movie. I like it but nothing really memorable
- Good - [Henchmen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3076510/) - Kids movie, but had its moments.
- Good - [Landscape with Invisible Hand](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7645334/) - Weird and interesting, I liked it.
- Good - [Argylle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15009428/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2024) - Predictable generic spy movie, it had a few moments but mostly forgettable
- Good - [Scarface](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (1983) - I didn't care for this on rewatch as much as I thought I would. It was the 5th movie in the gangsters series that I had been watching. After the Godfather, and goodfellas this didn't hit for me
- Good - [Rope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/) (1948) - I watched it as a study of a show where it was all shot in a single location with good cuts that made it seem like one single shot. Over all it was a great movie just really dated for me
- Good - [The Fall Guy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1684562/) (2024) - Fun love story between Ryan Gosling, and Emily Blunt, with some action. Hard to go wrong
- Good - [Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389872/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2024) - This was always going to be a hard movie to get right with so much back story leading up to it. There was no way that it was going to satisfy everyone. They did an okay job
- Good - [Brightburn](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7752126/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2019) - I liked this movie premise a lot, but it could have been executed better. Reminds me a lot of [Superman: Red Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Red_Son) that was amazing.
- Good - [Leave the World Behind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12747748/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2023) - Amazing acting with some smart ideas.
- Meh - [Blink Twice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14858658/) (2024) - It had some interesting ideas, and [Channing Tatum](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594/?ref_=tt_cst_t_2), and [Christian Slater](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000225/?ref_=tt_cst_t_4) did a great job in it. I just hated the main lead though [Naomi Ackie](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7609875/?ref_=tt_cst_t_1) very distracting in every scene that she was in.
- Meh - [Things Will Be Different](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27491225/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2024) - I would write a 1000 words essay on what was wrong with this movie. Time travel loop story with a twist, interesting plot. It just felt like it was written and directed by someone brand new who hasn't seen that many movies.
- Meh - [Triangle of Sadness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/) (2022) - I forgot I even seen this
- Meh - [The Holdovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/) (2023) - A lot of people loved this movie, I did not. Maybe its just because I don't care too much for [Paul Giamatti](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316079/)
- Meh - [Animal World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7946836/) (2018) - I watched this when it first came out and though it was a cleaver movie that had an interesting idea. On rewatch, it was a one trick pony, and didn't stand up to my memory of it.
- Meh - [Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21335356/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (2023) - Forgettable
- Bad - [Trap](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26753003/) (2024) - I put this on because my partner had just seen Taylor swift in concert and thought it might be a good riff on that... It was terrible from start to finish.
- Bad - [Robots](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12579470/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_3) - Terrible Nothing redeemable about this movie  
- Bad - [Strays](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15153532/) (2023) - Generic talking pets movie with nothing going on. Bad puns, bad jokes
- Bad - [Eighth Grade](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7014006/) (2018) - I tried to watch this movie because the very talented [Bo Burnham](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3102998/) wrote and directed it. But I hated it, and I couldn't get past the first 30 mins. Ended up turning it off.

## TV shows üì∫

Only including the series that I finished completely.

- Great - [Dispatches From Elsewhere](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8965666/) (Mini series) - If you watch one thing this year, make it this. It wonderful and query. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Great - [Scavengers Reign](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21056886/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Single season) - The most uniquely alien TV show that I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Great - [INVINCIBLE](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6741278/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 2) - Great TV, wonderful story, good character development. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Great - [Mr. & Mrs. Smith](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14044212/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1)
- Great - [The Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 4)
- Great - [Euphoria](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772296/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 2) - Wonderful TV
- Great - [Fallout](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - I am a fallout fanboy, they had my attention before the story even started. Its even better that it was well done.
- Great - [Hazbin Hotel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7216636/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - Unique and memorable
- Great - [Star Trek: Lower Decks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9184820/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 5) - Wonderful, final season, it will be missed but its good to end on a high note.
- Great - [Snowpiercer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6156584/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 5) - I was surprised when they pushed it for one more season, but they did a great job in closing out all the lose ends without spoiling everything they worked for in the previous seasons. Good way to end the series.
- Great - [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1-5) - Amazing all the way though. I rewatched this after a series of terrible movies and I needed a pallet cleanser. I am glad I did. It was masterfully done.
- Great - [Twilight of the Gods](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10625492/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - Wonderful. Leaned into the Mature rating without going overboard.
- Great - [Kaos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8550732/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - Great story telling, wonderful sets, pity that they cancelled it but I can imagine how much this costs to make.
- Great - [Devs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8134186/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1)
- Good - [Reacher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9288030/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 2)
- Good - [Gen V](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13159924/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - Fills a hole while waiting on more "The Boys", but not amazing.
- Good - [Malcolm in the Middle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1-6) - After breaking bad I needed more [Bryan Cranston](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186505/?ref_=tt_cst_t_2) and there was a rumor that they were coming back with a 7th season. This was a lot of TV but toughly enjoyable. Reminds me a lot of my childhood of being a delinquent
- Good - [Tokyo Vice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2887954/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1-2) - I was panning on heading to Japan and I was looking for some TV show to watch that would inspire me. This was a well acted, and had a good story line. They lost the plot a few times but recovered.
- Meh - [Only.Murders.in.the.Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11691774/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1-3) - I was looking for a murder mystery and this filled the hole. The first season was okay, but season 2-3 went down hill quickly.
- Meh - [3 Body Problem](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13016388/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 1) - I am a big fan of the books, I knew it was going to be hard to visualize and bring these books to the screen. I don't think they captured the feels from the books or told a story that is captivating on its own... Too bad.
- Meh - [The Legend of Vox Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11247158/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) (Season 3) - Getting tired, and I am losing interest.

Listened to 9,513 songs in 2024 (decrease of 17% from 2023) across 2,031 artists (decrease of 25% from 2023). An average of 26 songs per day. That‚Äôs approximately 26 days, 6 hours of music. The longest streak of listening to music was 26 days in a row.

My music tastes are concentrating on a fewer and fewer artists and I am listing to less music then years past.
