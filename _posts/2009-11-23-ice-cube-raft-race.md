Ice Cube Raft Race is a drinking game.

<strong>What you will need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 ice cube tray for each player</li>
	<li>1 straw for each player</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Each player gets one ice cube tray which you fill with your favorite beverage.  Then, with a straw, suck up each slot one at a time until the tray is gone.  Who ever finishes first wins.  Can also be played as a relay race.  Sounds easy but it gets harder after about 4 slots.

Note:  You can also make beer ice cubes from fallen soldiers (half empty beers) after a party, by using them to fill an icecube tray with beer and freezing it.  The great thing about beer icecubes is that they do not dilute your beer.
