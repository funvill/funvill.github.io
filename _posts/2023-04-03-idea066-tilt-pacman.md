## One Line Pitch

Use a accelerometer to control pacman on a LED Matrix

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\pacman.png' alt='pacman' style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px" >Make a 1 pixel version of [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) on a RGB LED Matrix similar to this project [1-Pixel Pac-Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPRTjCqYnI) from HACKADAY. Instead of a joystick use a [accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) where the user controls Pac-Man by tilting the LED Matrix panel in the direction that they want Pac-Man to go.

Information about [Pac-Man’s Ghost AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ataGotQ7ir8)

The first level should be the same as the original Pac-Man game. After that the maze and the ghosts should be randomized between a bunch of different AI schemes.

The same panel could be used for the [BIG LED Sand Toy – Raspberry Pi RGB LED Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Ce89f873Y) as well. Same equipment and sensors are used.

Other games that would work are<img src='\public\uploads\2023\raspberry_pi_hero-loopB.gif' alt='raspberry_pi_hero-loopB' style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px" >

- **Snake**: Use the accelerometer to control the direction of a snake as it moves around the LED matrix, trying to avoid obstacles and collect food.
- **Space Invaders**: Use the accelerometer to move a spaceship left and right as it tries to shoot down alien ships descending from the top of the LED matrix.
- **Pong**: Use the accelerometer to move a paddle up and down as it tries to hit a ball back and forth between two players.
- **Flappy** Bird: Use the accelerometer to control the height of a bird as it flies through a series of obstacles
