<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
The first player rolls all three dice in a dice cup and looks at the results keeping them secret from the other players.  The player then announces what they rolled (the player may lie about their roll).  The dice are announced highest to lowest with 6,6,6 =18 being the highest roll and 1,1,1=3 being the lowest.

The next player then can either choose to challenge  or call the first players bluff.
If a player calls, he can look at the dice and rolls 1,2,3 or none of the dice (the must announce how many dice they are rolling).  Then the next player gets a chance to challenge or call the previous players bluff.
If a player challenges the roll the dice are revealed, if the dice are lower then the announce roll then the challenger pays the player; if they are higher, then the player pays the challenger.

After someone challenges the dice a new round is started with the challenges.

If 6,6,6 is called, the next player must challenge the dice.

<strong>Example of Game Play</strong>
Player 1 rolls all three dice in a dice cup, (1,4,6) he announces 5,4,4
Player 2 calls and looks at the dice, and rolls 2 of the dice, the 5,1.  He rolls 6,5,1 and announces 6,5,6
Player 3 challenge the dice, the dice are revealed and player 2 pays player 3 one token.
A new round is started with Player 3.  Player 3 rolls all three dice in a dice cup and gets 5,5,5.  He announces 5,5,5.  Player 1 challenge the roll, the dice are revealed and player 1 pays player 3 one token.
