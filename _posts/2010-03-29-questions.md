Questions is a drinking game.

This is a favorite drinking game, although it&quot;s often difficult to find people willing to play it.  Mid-level buzz factor. Basic supplies only: people and beer.  It starts with a room full of people, the more the merrier.  The object is to ask a question when it's your turn, but this is much more difficult than it seems.  The rules are:
<ul>
	<li>Obviously, the infraction of any rule is punishable by drink.</li>
	<li>You can only ask one person one question at a time.</li>
	<li>The person who asks the question must address the person querried by name; no pointing (newcomers to a crowd are allowed some leeway until they learn names).</li>
	<li>The questions must be answerable with "
yes" or "
no", (This rule is optional, but be certain beforehand if it will be observed.)</li>
	<li>The person asked the question must immediately ask another person.</li>
	<li>Any hesitation, answering the question, laughing, or doing anything else besides asking somebody a question is punishable by drink.</li>
	<li>Asking a question back at the person who just asked is punishable by drink.</li>
	<li>All questions can be asked only once.  Simply rephrasing somebody else&quot;s question is a cheat.  A person who repeats a question must take a drink.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other notes:</strong>
If the crowd cracks up (for example,after  a spectacularly personal question), a "
Team Drink" is called.
The best way to play is to keep a question or two rolling around in your head to be spewed out after you are asked a question.  Good questions are the innocent sounding ones: "
Has the game started yet?" "
Is it past midnight?" "
Is that button on your shirt undone?"
Another good way to play is to get personal (the game usually descends to this level fairly quickly): "
Do you often pick your nose like that?" "
Do you masturbate often?" "
Are your breasts really 36DD?" "
Does your girlfriend arch when you make love?"
