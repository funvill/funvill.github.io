I got to spend two days in Shenzhen at the tail end of a vacation. I love hitting up the markets in [Huaqiang Road](https://goo.gl/maps/anWCCQarAC82). Makers paradise. Below is a list of the things that I picked up.  

- [LED Strip 12V SMD2835 Neon Light Round Line](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/LED-Strip-12V-SMD2835-Neon-Light-Round-Line-Low-Voltage-Flexible-Indoor-Outdoor-Waterproof-Soft-Light/32890285361.html) - I have purchased a lot of "Neon Light roap" in the past with mixed results. It was good to actually touch an feel it before buying it.
- [400 illuminuted rocker switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1pcs-12V-LED-illuminuted-rocker-switch-20A-12V-push-button-switch-Car-button-lights-ON-OFF/1000005695013.html) - Wantted to create a version of [Simone Giertz](https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz/status/825818138147033088), [The Everyday calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar). But when I got home I found that the 12v LED switches are actually 110v neon switches. Ugh.
- [NESPI Case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0kmd7kwRjo) - A retro PI case with a set of controllers.

- [Copper led "fairy light"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoRbHYJAwis) - Cheap LED fairy wire. I use it to add a bit of light to projects.
- [RUIDENG UM24/UM24C USB 2.0 Color LCD Display Tester Voltage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP0DaCQyF5E) - Lots of features used to determin how much current a USB charger is using. Logs to CSV. Very userful for my LEDs projects.
