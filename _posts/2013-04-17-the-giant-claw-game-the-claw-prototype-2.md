<img class="size-medium wp-image-3240 alignright" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" alt="claw prototype 2" src="/public/uploads/2013/04/claw-300x167.png" width="300" height="167" />This is the second prototype of the claw. I really liked <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/CRANE-GAME/">the claw design by Marc Cryan</a> that I found on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables.com</a> but I wanted it to have three prongs instead of two. I did this prototype out of cardboard using trial and error to get the right size for each part.

I tried doing the math to get the right ratios between each sections, but it was harder then I would have thought. I ended up taking the cardboard prototype apart and measuring each sections. Not the best way of doing it but it worked.

I cut it with a ban-saw as VHS's laser was down for repairs  It can picks up balls most of the time on the first try and holds them even when swing the claw around. I think its going to work great.

Next I am going to attach a motor to the claw so that it can be automated.
