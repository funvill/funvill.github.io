Klondike is a dice poker game.
Klondike is loosely based on poker originating in cheap casinos on the American frontier.  Its really easy to play if you know anything about poker; even if you don&quot;t its still pretty easy.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>5 dices</li>
	<li>A sheet of paper to keep score</li>
	<li>1 or more people</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
The banker or dealer rolls first and creates a poker hand from his roll.
The players then each take there turn to roll the 5 dice and try to make a poker hand.
Five of a kind (4, 4, 4, 4, 4)
Four of a kind (3, 3, 3, 3,1)
Full House, Three of a kind and a pair (4, 4, 4, 5, 5)
Three of a kind (6, 6, 6, 3, 1)
Two pairs (5, 5, 3, 3, 1)
One pair (5, 5, 1, 2, 6)

<strong>Rules</strong>
Only one throw is allowed.
The numbers are ranked high to low as 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
Any dice that are not used are ignored.
The dealer wins a tie.

<strong>Example game play</strong>
The dealer rolls, (5, 5, 5, 3, 1) and has three of a kind.
Player 1 rolls (6, 6, 6, 2, 5) and has three of a kind but the dealer wins ties.
Player 2 rolls (3, 3, 2, 2, 2) and a full house beats the dealer.
Player 2 wins.

<strong>Variations</strong>
The casino variation is played with 10 dice using a table with a layout with three sections, €œwin€, €œlose€, €œBeat two aces€.  The banker rolls five dice and sets them sides.  The players then take turns rolling the other 5 dice trying to beat the banker.  A player that bets on win must try to throw a combination that is higher then the bankers, while a player that bets on lose has to try to roll less then the banker.  A player that bets on two aces must throw at lest two pairs.  Because all ties win for the house, the house has the edge on €˜win&quot; or €˜lose&quot; bets at 5.194%.  The house edge on €˜beat two aces&quot; is 11.111%.
