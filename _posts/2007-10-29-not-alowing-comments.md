I was browsing <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com">warrenellis.com</a> website the other day and tuned in to his <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=5239">4am pod cast</a>.
After it was done I went to leave a comment only to find that comments have been turned off.

Instead he suggest that you make a comment on your own site and use a track back to his website.
Warren Ellis is a decently big fish on the intarweb(s) so he actually gets track back.
I checked <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/www.warrenellis.com">Technorati</a> 5600 links with an authority: 1,349 thats damn good.
Comparatively <a href="http://www.everydayfiction.com">EveryDayFiction.com</a> has 140 links and an authority 83.

Its a good idea.
Lots of link backs so his Google rank goes up.
When someone comments on one of his posts, all of there readers also hear about it and more people view his site.

Anyways as for my comment.
