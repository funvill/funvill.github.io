Fourteens is a dice game.
This is a banking game that was popular in the Midwest of the USA between the 1930's and 1950's.  It was often played in taverns which would make payoffs in drinks until anti-gambling legislation killed off the game to a great extent.  An operator will often provide a score sheet which states the rules and payoffs made on bets.  Of course the odds are always in the operators favor.

This game is very similar to twenty-six.
