Fourteens is a dice game.
This is a banking game that was popular in the Midwest of the USA between the 1930's and 1950's.  It was often played in taverns which would make payoffs in drinks until anti-gambling legislation killed off the game to a great extent.  An operator will often provide a score sheet which states the rules and payoffs made on bets.  Of course the odds are always in the operators favor.

This game is very similar to twenty-six.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>10 dice</li>
</ul>
<strong>The object of the game</strong>
To get as many points by rolling the point number on ten dice.

<strong>How to play</strong>
A player rolls all 10 dice. If they roll a three of a kind or better that number becomes there point number.
If they don&quot;t throw three of a kind or better then they may choose any value as their point number and score three points regardless.
They have four more throws rolling the ten dice and score a point for everytime their point number appears.
Players win if they score 14 or more, or if the last four rolls of the dice fail to give up a single occurrence of their point number.
A winning player is paid at odds of 8-1.
