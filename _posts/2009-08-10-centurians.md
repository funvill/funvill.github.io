Centurians is a Drinking game
This game is also known as Century Club, Centurions, Power Hour, or The '100'

Basically you take a shot of beer once a min for 100 mins or until the other person passes out.  As easy as it sounds rarely anyone completes all 100 shots before passing out or violently puking.

<strong>The rules</strong>
You can play with as many people as you like, (2+ players recommended)
You can go to the bathroom but you must catch up for every min that you are away, max of 5 mins
No chugging of beers, you have to drink it one shot at a time.
No puking
Anyone that gets to 100 shots wins and gains Centurion status.

The game isn&quot;t that hard when you think about it.  100 shots of beers is about 13 beers its just the pace that you have to keep drinking at.
<strong>
Variation of this game</strong>
The '100' you are allowed to puke but you are not allowed out of your seat for the full 100 mins and every 10 mins you must take a shot of hard bar (vodka, rum, ect).
100 beers in 3 days (one weekend, including Friday) if you complete all 100 beers you are even more hardcore then the the people that completed €˜The '100'
