Maybe you should not buy equipment from dell. This is my story and the reason that I will not buy from dell in the future.

I purchased a [Dell 27 USB-C Ultrathin Monitor: S2719DC](https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-27-usb-c-ultrathin-monitor-s2719dc/apd/210-aqpv/monitors-monitor-accessories?ref=frommyaccount) as part of black friday sales on *Friday, November 20, 2020* for *$510.71* 45% off. (Note: Never buy from dell at full price aka the sucker price, they always have a sale every 2-3 months for upwards of 40% off) I used $27 of Dell rewards I had from a previously ordered monitor.

After I made the purchase, I found an additional 10% off coupon for black friday monitors. I contacted support.

They cannot apply the coupon after the order was place, annoying but understadable. To cancel the order, they have to try to do customer retention but the offer that they gave me was rediculus. I stand to gain $45 with the cupon, but they were only willing to offer me $43 credit that would expire before I planned to buy a new monitor. No deal.

I waited 48 hours and the order was not cancelled. Messageed again and went thought the same proces with the same customer retention offer and the same 24-48-hour estimate for cancelation.

I noticed that they did not refund the Dell rewards ($27) with the cancellation of the previouse order.

Contacted them again via phone (No transcript) It takes up to 5 bussiness days for the Dell rewards to be refunded. By that time, the Black friday deal would be over, and they cannot "rain check" the deal for me while they figure out the Dell Rewards. Angry, but I still wanted the monitor, so I went thought with the new order, with the 10% coupon. (lost $27 of dell rewards)

I orderd the new monitor on *Friday, November 27, 2020* for *$460.31* checking the shipping address before I ordered.

On *December 1st, 2020* I got the "Dell Order Has Shipped for Order Number: ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛" email with the wrong shipping address. It was shipping to the billing address not the shipping address. I took a screenshot of my order when I placed it on *Friday, November 27, 2020* and it had the right shipping address. The "Dell Order Has Shipped" email had the wrong address.

Arup M: Thank you for contacting Dell Customer Care chat. My name is Arup Mishra. Please give me a moment while I review your case details and I will be glad to assist you. 
Arup M: Hi Steven, how are you? 
Steven: I am doing well. I noticed that the shipping address is incorrect on my order 
Steven: It should be 
Steven ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
425 ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
Vancouver, BC ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ 
Arup M: I regret to know about the issue. 
Arup M: Let me see what best can be done here. 
Arup M: Is this the order number ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛, you are referring to? 
Steven: yes 
Arup M: Thank you. 
Arup M: I have your  email address as ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛@⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛.com and phone Number is ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
Steven: Yes that is correct 
Arup M: Thank you. 
Arup M: ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ is expected to be shipped on or before 11-30. 
Arup M: We are keeping a follow up till the order ships and available in Canada. 
Arup M: We can not able to update the address for you. 
Steven: Pardon I don't understand you. 
Steven: How do I change the shipping address for this order ? 
Arup M: Steven, we will not be able to update the shipping address when the order is in production. 
Steven: Damn it. Well Should I cancel the order and reorder again ? 
Steven: It can not be shipped to the address on file 
Steven: If it is shipped to that address it will be returned. 
Arup M: Steven. I guess you did read what I have mentioned. 
Steven: Angry 
Arup M: I have mentioned that we will update the address once the order ships from USA facilities and available in Canada. 
Arup M: My apologies if you did not understand my point. 
Steven: Okay, that makes more sense... This statement makes no sense.  "We can not able to update the address for you. " 
Steven: That statment is why I was confused. 
Arup M: My apologies for the confusion. 
Steven: To confirm... You will update the shipping address once the package arrives in Canada... I personally do not need to take any other actions... Is this correct ? 
Arup M: Absolutely, you got this. 
Steven: Thank you 
Arup M: ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ is the case reference number. 
Steven: Thank you 
Steven: Thank you for your time and effort.

From this interaction "You will update the shipping address once the package arrives in Canada... I personally do not need to take any other actions... Is this correct ?"... No action for me, dell is on top of it.

Tue. Dec. 8, 2020 - 7:26 p.m. VANCOUVER, BC Shipment delivered to STEVEN at: GUARD of ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
```

Delivered to the wrong address. Delivered to the billing address instead of the shipping address. Because of COVID the billing address is an empty warehouse with no one in it. There are no guards, and no reason anyone would be there. I do not know who could have recived the montor. The warehouse is a couple of hours away from my address.

Call up Dell (no transcript). They cannot help me directly. They can send their shipper (purolator) back to the address to try and recover the monitor and return it to Dell if they cannot recover the montior it effectly my problem. Shit out of luck. Angry, Fuck you Dell.

Mon. Dec. 14, 2020 a coworker took the 2-hour drive into the warehouse and found the monitor. It was recived by a neighbouring business (purolator problem), I guess the shipper decided to deliver it there when he found our warehouse closed.

I get a quote for shipping it from my coworker’s house or warehouse to my house (the shipping address), cost $140 for shipping. Call up dell (no transcript). My case has been passed to a specialist and he cannot help me. Wait on the specialist.

7 days go by... In this time, I have walked the 20 mins down the road and purchsed a new monitor from Bestbuy for less then the monitor from Dell. Better in all ways, and it has instore return. I give the Dell monitor to my coworker. Dell specialist eventually does call me, and they can offer me nothing but the ability to pick up the moniotor from the warehouse where no one is and ship it back to Dell, to be shipped out again. Gawd knows how long that would take.

Do not buy Dell.
