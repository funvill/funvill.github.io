## One Line Pitch

Procedurally generated Art PCB of mushrooms for the [#GameOfShrroms](https://yumfactory.com/gameofshrooms/) art project. Backlit LEDs to add a nice glowing effect.

## Description

> [Game of Shrooms](https://yumfactory.com/gameofshrooms/) is a once a year world-wide art N seek event created by [Attaboy](https://yumfactory.com/). The next Game of Shrooms happens on June 10th, 2023. On that day, artists from all over the world hide their original mushroom-themed artworks in public places, then they give hints (often on social media) for others to find AND KEEP!

Fill the front face of the PCB with procedurally generated artistic PCB traces. These traces are not connected to anything and are purely esthetic.  

The back side of the mushroom would have several RGB LEDs. These LEDS are positioned in such a way that when the mushroom is mounted to a wall the light illuminates out the sides to create a glowing effect. The RGB LEDs should be programmable and cycle through a series of patterns.

A sensor could be put on the front to detect if it is day or night. The LED would only glow at night. Kind of like a night light.

Stretch goal would be to make this battery powered.

I would need to convert his output into a SVG, then use [svg2shenzhen](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen) to convert the KiaKad files.
