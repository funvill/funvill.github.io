## One Line Pitch

Use a CNC to make paint dot paintings one dot at a time

## Description

> [Pointillism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism) is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.

The CNC is programmed to dip the paint brush into the acrylic paints and dab a canvas with the paints. The dabs of paint will have a tiny 2-3 mm height on them to give them depth. Allow full color and tool changing of the paint brush.

To program the CNC create a program that takes a photo as an input then splits the photo into pixels all 2mm wide, then finds the average color in that 2mm section.
