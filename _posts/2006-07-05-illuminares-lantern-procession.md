As dusk falls over Trout Lake Park in East Vancouver, families and friends come together from far and wide to witness an extraordinary celebration of light.

On this night, the Illuminares Lantern Procession fills the air with music, and thousands of paper lanterns come alive with fire. A brilliant spectacle of weaving serpents, birds in flight, planets in orbit, schools of fish, and all sorts of glowing and shimmering creatures of the imagination.

Processional bands playing world and folk music encourage spectators on the sidelines to join in the journey through the park. Along the way, audiences pass brightly illuminated displays and engaging circus performances of juggling, dancing, clowning, and so much more.

The Illuminares Lantern Procession builds up to an amazing show of art, music, dance, fire sculptures, torch choreography, and dazzling fireworks on the lake.

<strong>Where:</strong> Trout Lake Park Victoria Drive &amp; 15th Avenue
<strong>When:</strong> July 29, 2006 - 7 - 11 pm (procession @ 9pm)
