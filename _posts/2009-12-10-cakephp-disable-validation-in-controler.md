When upgrading an old web application to start using CakePHP but the old systems was riddled with invalid data. When the creating the CRUD system I need a way of updating this invalid data.

The following line of code will disable the validation in the controller.

<code>$this-&gt;Story-&gt;validate = array(); // Stop valadation on the story.</code>
