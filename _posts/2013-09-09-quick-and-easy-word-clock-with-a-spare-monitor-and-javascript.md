LED strips or shift registers, how about a relay board and an Arduino. After much discussion we came up with the idea of using a laser cut a sheet of wood that has all the different words cut out as a mask for a monitor. We placed the sheet of wood in front of the monitor and use JavaScript to illuminate certain parts of the screen to highlight words.

This hack took about two hours to complete as none of us knew JavaScript, and turned out pretty well.
