## One Line Pitch

A website that lets users upload their own glyphs/images for the top of keycaps

## Description

A keyboard designer tool built into a website that allows users to build custom keycaps that are made or ordered (Print on demand) with lots of options.

### Options

- [Keycap profiles](https://keebnews.com/keycap-profiles/0): OEM, Cherry, SA, XDA, DSA, ASA, GK1, GK2, G20, MDA
- Colors: Full RGB whatever the dye sublimation printer allows for
- [Dye sublimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNZkzK4l0F8), UV printing, Double shot ABS, Resin Cast
- Opaque or semi transparent
- Custom glyphs/images for the top of keycaps
- Keycap Sets: full-size, tenkeyless, or 60%, etc...
- Material: ABS or PBT plastic, or even keycaps made of metal or wood

3rd party artists can upload their own patterns and sell them for a profit.

3rd party artists can upload their own STL files and molds can be made for resin cast keycaps.

This service can be used to create [Idea 7 - Emoji Macro Pad Keyboard](/idea007-emoji-macro-pad-keyboard).

- [WASD Keyboards](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/105-key-iso-custom-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html) does exactly what I was looking for only better and has been doing it for years. They even have a great tool for designing keyboard caps.
