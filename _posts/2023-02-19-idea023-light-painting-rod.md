## One Line Pitch

A programmable strip of LEDs that can be attached on a rod for light painting.

## Description

A device with several buttons, knobs, accelerometer/gyroscope, and microcontroller. A connection to an addressable LED strip. The button and knobs allow for switching of the patterns on the LEDs.

The addressable LED strip can be attached to a rod to be used in light painting. The accelerometer/gyroscope can be used to track motion though the air for some of the patterns.

A bluetooth radio could be used to trigger the patterns remotely for when the LED strip is attached to something remote.
