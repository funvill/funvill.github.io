## One Line Pitch

Take several time lapse videos of the Cherry Blossom park while its blooming

## Description

Using several different cameras take timelapse photos of the cherry blossom trees blooming in cherry blossom park.

- [GoPro Hero 10](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html) - Good at wide angle and high resolution, only lasts about 2.5 hours on battery. Can run continuously using AC power and USB adapter
- [Raspberry PI HD Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) - 12.5 MP with a fixed CS mount lens. Can push to a NAS for backup of images, and store offline. Can be hard to get the focus just right
- [Sony a6400](https://www.sony.ca/en/interchangeable-lens-cameras/products/ilce-6400) - Great lenses, but expensive to keep unattended
- [ESP32-cam](https://www.arducam.com/esp32-machine-vision-learning-guide/) - Very low resolution camera but battery powered and lasts about 24 hours on a battery bank. Can send photos via HTTP POST back to a server for storage, or on a SD card
- [WyzeCam](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-cam-og?related_selling_plan=41618559008930) - Better than the ESP32-cam resolution but you need to hack the firmware for it to take timelapse videos
- [SQ12](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32848168390.html) - Mini DV camera, ultra cheap 12M(4032*3024) camera. Good timelapse software settings, lasts 24 hours on a single charge. Tiny

The cherry blossoms are already starting to bud and should bloom within the next few weeks. It would take a few days to get all the equipment set up beforehand and ready.
