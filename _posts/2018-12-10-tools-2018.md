This is a snapshot of the tools that I was using in 2018. A more up-to-date version can be found on the [tools and equipment page](/tools).

Everyday I use a series of tools and equipment that make my life easier. These tool change and morph each year. This is my list of recommended tools and equipment.

Previous snapshots of my tools and equipment lists can be found here: [2016](https://blog.abluestar.com/tools-2016)

Inspired by [UsesThis.com](https://usesthis.com/) - A collection of interviews asking people from all walks of life, what they use to get the job done.

# Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is *Steven Smethurst* and live two lives. During the day I am a software engineer at [Chipkin Automation Systems](http://store.chipkin.com/) and at night I am a maker, hacker and artist.

# What has changed since 2016

- I use [linux subsystem for windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (aka Ubuntu bash on Windows) every single day. I don't know how I got a long with out it before. Its amazing.
- I started using [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/) instead of [Google play music](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#) primarly because *google play music* does not support [family plans](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/family/) with [Google apps for doamins](https://support.google.com/a/answer/53926?hl=en) aka GSuite. I like the social aspect of Spotify, and that other device logged into your account can act as a remote (next song, volumn, sort playlist, etc..).
- I stopped using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) entirely in favor of [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). The dependency manager in *PlatformIO* is a killer feature that has made my project much more portable. 
- I quit [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/). The thing that made me start searching for an alternative to *Chrome* was that they started to restrict adblocking software. (1) [Google Struggles to Justify Why It's Restricting Ad Blockers in Chrome](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/evy53j/google-struggles-to-justify-making-chrome-ad-blockers-worse), (2) [Manifest V3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPu6Wy4LWR66EFLeYInl3NzzhHzc-qnk4w4PX-0XMw8/edit#heading=h.5ottncv8stov) (3) [Chrome extension manifest v3 proposal #338](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417). After switching I got use to *FireFox* pretty quickly. The privacy and anti tracking features were a nice bounus. The only feature that I miss is [Google ChromeCast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast) button in my browser. It was convenient to share my browser window with my chrome cast, now I juse use remote desktop (RDP).
- I went from a [Galaxy S6 Edge](http://www.samsung.com/ca/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/galaxy-s/SM-G925WZKABMC) to a [Samsung S8](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s8/) and I will never use a Samsung phone again. The hardware was great exactly what I look for in a device, but Samsung [Bloatware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat) was unbearable. Over 40 apps that you can't uninstall is ridiculous. It seems like every other month some new bloatware is forced on my by a software patch.

# What software do you use?

- [Pixel 3](https://store.google.com/ca/product/pixel_3) - Android phone. Google's flagship phone. Its wonderful.

# What would be your dream setup?

I would upgrade my monitor setup to a 34"+ ultra wide monitor such as [Acer XR342CK Pbmiiqphuzx](https://wclink.co/link/29241/151265/4/83270?merchant=Amazon). Finnely I would love to get my hands on a futurisitc, not currently avalaible, augmented reality (AR) glasses that supported super human vision.
