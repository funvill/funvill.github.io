<a href="http://www.oksocial.org/"><img src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/br-button2.thumbnail.jpg" alt="br-button2.jpg" align="right" /></a> I have always had trouble striking up conversation with random people, I like to be introduced to someone first to have the 'Its OK to talk to me' smile and hand shake.

I hate getting that unwelcome, confused look that you sometimes get when you try to strike up a conversation with a random somebody and there trying to find out what you are trying to sell them.

To day I was reading one of my RSS feeds for <a href="http://www.beyondrobson.com/people/2007/07/cant_talk_to_vancouverites_ok/">BeyondRobson.com</a>, and I came across this story <a href="http://www.beyondrobson.com/people/2007/07/cant_talk_to_vancouverites_ok/">can't talk to vancouverites</a> about <a href="http://www.beyondrobson.com/people/2007/07/cant_talk_to_vancouverites_ok/"></a><a href="http://www.oksocial.org/">Ok Social</a>.

Basically its a button that you can wear that tells the world that its OK for you to talk to you. A button that tells people that you are willing to take some time out of your day to talk to a random person.

My first thought was who in there right mind would wear that button but over the day the idea grew on me and I ended up requesting on for my self from <a href="http://www.oksocial.org/">Ok Social</a>. Apparently the buttons are free "The idea is to make this a friendlier place, not make money."

Its an interesting idea, I hope it works out and I can't wait to find someone else in the city that also has the button.
