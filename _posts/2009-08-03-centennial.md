Centennial is a Dice game, also known as Martinetti and Ohio.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>3 dice</li>
	<li>A sheet of paper with twelve squares to keep track of what number you are on.</li>
	<li>A token for each player</li>
</ul>
<strong>The object of the game</strong>
Be the first player to make the round trip from position 1 to 12 and back to 1 again.

<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Each player in turn rolls three dice and moves to square 1 if the throw contains a 1.  To move to square 2 the throw must contain either a 2 or two 1s, and to move to square 3 the throw must contain either a 3, three 1s, or a 2 and a 1, and so on.  The value of any single die, the sum of any two, and the sum of all three may be counted.

A player can move more than one place in any single turn by using more than one combination of dice values.  For example, if a player on their first throw rolls a 1, 2, and a 4, they may use the 1 to move to position 1 on the board; the 2 takes them to position 2; the 2 and 1 together to position 3; the 4 to position 4; the 4 and 1 to position 5; the 4 and 2 to position 6; and the sum of the 1, 2 and 4 takes them to position 7.

A player may also move if an opponent overlooks a number that they require.  In this case any other player, requiring the same number, may claim it, as long as they do so as soon as the dice are passed on.
