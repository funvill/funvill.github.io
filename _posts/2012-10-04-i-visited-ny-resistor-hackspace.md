While in New York to see <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/">World Maker Faire</a>, I got a chance to see the <a href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">NY Resistor hackspace</a>. It was a quite night as most people where still tired from there adventures at Maker Faire, but I was able to meet a few good people, drop off some stickers, and take some pictures of their space.
