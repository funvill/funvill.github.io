Par is a dice game.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>5 dice</li>
	<li>Chips, tokens or coins.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Object of the game</strong>
To score more then 24 with five dice and eventually collect everyones chips/tokens.

<strong>How to play the game</strong>
A player rolls all five dice, if the score is above 24 everyone pays them a token for every point above 24.
For example: if they roll 26 they would receive 2 tokens from each player.

If a player rolls less or equal to 24 he may put side one or more dice and rolla the remainder. Â The dice that he puts aside cannot be rolled again and you have to put at least one die aside to roll the remaining dice.

If a player rolls less then 25 after he has set sides all his dice, he pays the other player for every point below 24.
For example: Â A player rolls 20 he pays 4 tokens to each player.
If a player can not pay out everyone, he hands out one token at a time to everyone starting with the player on his right. Â If a player has no tokens he is out of the game.

<strong>Example game play</strong>
Player one rolls all five dice and gets 5,5,6,3,4 for a total of 23 he decides to put aside the 5,5,6 and roll the 3 and 4.
Player one rolls the two remaining dice and gets 4,6 he now has a total of 26 he decides to stop and everyone one pays him 2 tokens.
Player two rolls all five dice and gets 2,3,6,5,2 for a total of 18 he decides to put side the 5,6 and rolls the three remaining dice.
Player two rolls the three remaining dice and gets 1,2,4 for a total of 18 he decides to put aside the 4 and roll the two remaining dice.
Player two rolls the two remaining dice and gets 1,2 for a total of 18 he decides to put aside the 2 and roll the remaining one die
Player two rolls the last remaining die and gets 2 for a total of 19 (2+2+4+5+6=19) he pays everyone 5 tokens.

Play continues until one person collects everyone's tokens or chips.
