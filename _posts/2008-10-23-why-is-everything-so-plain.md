Why is everything so plain?

As a web developer and programmer I found myself spending more time redesigning this site then actually making content for it. I'm on my 15th redesign so far, with none of them lasting longer than 6 months. Every time I finely get to a stage where I am happy with the design I would see a neat new feature on someone else site that I just have to add to my site.

So I decided on this "My 16th and final redesign!" to strip away all the distractions and create a clean simple template that just works.
