While visiting <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/">Toronto</a> I was able to make it down to <a href="http://hacklab.to/">Hacklab.To</a> and get a tour of their space.

It was a very well set up space with lots of projects all around the space. Including an <a href="http://hacklab.to/archives/automata-or-things-that-go-put-put/">automated train system with a crane</a>,  Lots of <a href="http://hacklab.to/archives/brain-food-double-post-raspberry-pi-cases-and-train-overlord-progress/">RaspberryPI projects</a> including an interactive touch screen that gave information about the space.

I was very impressed with their space. I took some photos, and stickers, dropped off some <a href="/the-last-batch-of-geocoins/">GeoCoins</a> and a <a href="http://blog.openbeamusa.com/">OpenBeam starter set</a>.
