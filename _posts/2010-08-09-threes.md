Threes (commonly called Tripps) is a gambling dice game.  As it can be played for any amount of time and requires almost no equipment, it has become very popular as a street game, primarily played in makeshift games organized in alleys or living rooms.

<strong>What you Need to Play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>5 dice</li>
	<li>2 or more players</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Object of the Game</strong>
The object of the game is to achieve the lowest total score after adding up the values of all five dice, counting threes as zeroes.

<strong>How to Play</strong>
A player rolls all five dice and decides which ones to keep.  The player can keep as many as he or she wishes, but must keep at least one die after each roll. Once a die has been kept, it is out of play for the rest of the turn.  This means that a player can have at most five rolls in a turn.

Your score is the total of all the dice that you have kept.

The best possible score is 0, which happens when a player rolls 3-3-3-3-3, but if any player rolls 6-6-6-6-6 (a.k.a. "
Shooting the Moon"), they win that round instantly and no one else need roll.
