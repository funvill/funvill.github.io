Threes (commonly called Tripps) is a gambling dice game. Â As it can be played for any amount of time and requires almost no equipment, it has become very popular as a street game, primarily played in makeshift games organized in alleys or living rooms.

<strong>What you Need to Play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>5 dice</li>
	<li>2 or more players</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Object of the Game</strong>
The object of the game is to achieve the lowest total score after adding up the values of all five dice, counting threes as zeroes.

<strong>How to Play</strong>
A player rolls all five dice and decides which ones to keep. Â The player can keep as many as he or she wishes, but must keep at least one die after each roll. Once a die has been kept, it is out of play for the rest of the turn. Â This means that a player can have at most five rolls in a turn.

Your score is the total of all the dice that you have kept.

The best possible score is 0, which happens when a player rolls 3-3-3-3-3, but if any player rolls 6-6-6-6-6 (a.k.a. â€œShooting the Moonâ€), they win that round instantly and no one else need roll.
