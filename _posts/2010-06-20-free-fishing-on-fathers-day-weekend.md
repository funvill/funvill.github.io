Did you know that in BC you get a <a href="http://www.bcfamilyfishing.com/default.htm">free freshwater fishing licence</a> for<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day"> fathers day</a> weekend. The weekend was set up in order to get people interested in fishing, to teach folks the rules of fishing and to give them a look at what&quot;s being done to preserve, enhance and create fish habitat.

Its a decent idea.
