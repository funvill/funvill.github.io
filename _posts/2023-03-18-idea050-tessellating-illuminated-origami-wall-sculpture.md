## One Line Pitch

Origami Sacred Geometry + Individually addressable RGB LEDs + Wall Sculpture + interactive

## Description

<a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/origamimosaicworks/8333076712/in/photostream/'><img src="/public/uploads/2023/kota-hiratsuka--red-mini-flower.png" alt="kota-hiratsuka--red-mini-flower" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/></a>Tiling [tessellating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation) star shaped modular Origami in a repeating pattern. Similar to [Kinga Kubowicz - Moduuli](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbcz24_q4Er/?hl=en) [2](https://www.kingkongdesign.com/moduulipaperpanels) or [Origami Mosaics by Kota Hiratsuka](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2012/12/origami-mosaics-by-kota-hiratsuka/)

Each cell will have its own Individually addressable RGB LEDs similar to my [Digital Stained Glass Windows](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2018-stained-glass-window/) project.

Though the sculpture scatters a few human detection sensors like [Passive infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor) (PIR) sensor or [Nondispersive Infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor) (NDIR) Sensor. This allows me to determine if there is a person looking at the sculpture or where in the sculpture they are located. This information can be used in the LED animations.

The tiling Origami shapes would be created with plastic [Vellum Paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082D1FYTL). Semi transparent and a good diffuser for LED light as well as foldable for Origami shapes. It's also plastic so it should hold its shape well and could be cleaned with a damp cloth. It is more expensive then normal paper at $12 for 50x sheets but the advantages over normal paper should be worth it.

Use a [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) for the brains, then it can connect to the internet or home assistant to provide more information.

## Prior art

- [Serenity: An origami wall sculpture](https://charlyn.codes/origami-wall-art/) - Includes LEDs but not every title has its own LED, and it uses pyramids instead of stars.
- [Origami Sacred Geometry](http://cocosato.co.uk/portfolio/origami-sacred-geometry/) - Tiling, tessellating, module Origami in similar shapes.
- [Kinga kubowiczâ€™s Moduuli](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/article/kinga-kubowicz-has-created-moduuli-a-collection-of-geometric-origami-wall-art/) - The shape I am looking for. The paper already has the shape and uses staples to connect each section. A lot easier to manufacture than traditional Origami.

## Market

People who want interactive beautiful wall sculptures that display information as well as pretty colors.

## Implementation
