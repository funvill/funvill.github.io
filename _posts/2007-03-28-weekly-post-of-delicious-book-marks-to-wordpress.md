<img src="/public/uploads/2007/03/delicious-icon.gif" alt="delicious-icon.gif" align="right" />Thank to the help of <a href="http://herebox.org/blog/2006/05/29/361/">herebox.org</a> I was able to add the ability to get new links from my del.icio.us account and post them on this site once a week. the script uses curl instead of fopen which is much more secure.

I made a few changes to the script.
<ul>
	<li>Instead of posting the links to my blog right away I posted them with a draft status so I could review and make any necessary changes.</li>
	<li>I added the Tag links for the <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">UltimateWarriorTags</a> plug-in so that my users could look for other posts that they also might be interested in.</li>
</ul>
The original <a href="http://herebox.org/blog/2006/05/29/361/">herebox.org</a> script can be downloaded from his site. <a href="http://herebox.org/pub/code/yawd-curl-1.0.txt">yawd-curl-1.0 script</a>

My modified version can be downloaded from my site <a href="/public/uploads/2007/03/delicious27mar2007_1449.zip" title="UltimateWarriorTags with yawd-curl-1.1 script">UltimateWarriorTags with yawd-curl-1.1 script</a>

Example: <a href="/delicious-03-28-2007/ ">Delicious-03-28-2007</a>
