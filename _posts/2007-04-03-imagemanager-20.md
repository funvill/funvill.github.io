<img src="/public/uploads/2007/03/image-missing.png" alt="image-missing" align="right" />One of the most important Wordpress plugin's for any blogger, ImageManager alowes you to resize, crop, rotate, flip or scale uploaded images.

Having an image included with your posts make it stick out, but if that image is huge or has random crap in the background it can become annoying.

I highly suggest this plugin to any blogger that uploads images to there blog
