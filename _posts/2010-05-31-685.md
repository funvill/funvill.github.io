Simplified Craps is a dice game.
This is a simplified version of craps that is often played on the street of New York.

<strong>How to play the game</strong>
The thrower is paid by the house if he rolls two dice and gets any of the following combination; 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 or 12, and loses if he rolls 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
Total                   Payoff
2                           3 to 1
3 or 4                  1 to 1 (evens)
10 or 11             2 to 1
12                         5 to 1

The player is still at a disadvantage with the overall house edge at 2.8%.
Operators not satisfied with their edge sometimes change the odds on a total of 12 to a more modest 3 to 1.  Some New York mob games were known to pay even money (1-1) on totals of 10, and 4 to 1 on a total of 12.
