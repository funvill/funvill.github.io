This post is part of a series on the [stained glass windows project](/projects/2018-stained-glass-window). 

Below is the hardware and parts that I am using this project. 

### 6 mm semi-transparent white acrylic 

6 mm is the most common and cheapest thickness of acrylic that is available. This acrylic is 60% transparent creating a good difusion pattern to scatter the LED light. I also have a bunch of it that I salvaged from a dumpster behind a sign shop. 

### Square 12mm WS2812B RGB LEDS (NeoPixels) 

The [WS2812 RGB LEDs](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf) are cheap on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) as most people are moving to the better APA106 version. I picked up a few thousand of these square versions a few years ago in a massive group buy and I am still making my way through the stockpile. 

I selected the square version over the bullet version to keep the profile of the panels smaller.

### Wemos D1 mini ESP8266 with Arduino firmware 

For most of my projects I have moved on to using the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) as the CPU speed is much better then ESP8266, but I have a stockpile of these older chips and the requirements of this project are well within the capability of the [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview).

The hardware is a $3 [Wemos d1 mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/D1-mini-Mini-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266/1331105_32529101036.html?spm=2114.12010608.0.0.7a2e719fe6cHq2)

I am using the [ESP826 arduino core library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino), and [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED).  

### 5 volt 5 amp AC to DC power supply 

Each LED at full brightness consumes 60 mA, normally running at 20 mA. Each panel has between 30-45 LEDs. With a total of 7 panels. I needed around 6 Amps power supply but Power supplies larger than 5 Amps is expensive. I programed the LEDs to be 20% darker than their max, to reduce the power requirement to be less than 5 Amp so I could use this cheaper power supply.
