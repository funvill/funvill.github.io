An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life.

And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.

### [Mr. Nobody (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/)

Stunningly directed. Complex, an experience revolving around the notion of choice, and leaves you reflecting upon your own choices. (Also jared leto guys)

### [Pontypool (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/)

This ultra low budget psychological thriller takes a refreshingly low key approach to a zombie apocalypse, focusing on a small town radio station that unknowingly becomes ground zero during the outbreak. Stephen McHattie (Watchmen, 300) delivers a powerhouse performance as the radio presenter who breaks the news of the pandemic, complete with a convincingly silky voice, but what really makes this worth watching is the constant buildup of tension and the untraditional and unpredictable nature of the zombie plague. At times the film's origins as a radio play are just a little too obvious, but the running time still flies by and the movie makes the absolute most out of the sole location of the radio booth.

### [Children of Men (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/)

### [Spirited Away (2001)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/)

10 year-old Chihiro and her parents are riding along during a family outing through the countryside when they stumble across an amusement park that has seemingly been abandoned for years. Despite Chihiro's premonitions about the creepy setting, her parents explore the area and eventually discover and indulge in an empty eatery filled with fresh food. As a result of their unfaithfulness, they are magically turned into pigs, which in turn scares away Chihiro. She meets the enigmatic Haku, who explains to her that this land is actually a magical bath house, a kind of holiday resort, where supernatural beings seek comfort away from the earthly realm and she must work here, as laziness is not permitted, to free both herself and her parents from the mystical land.

### [Memento (2000)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/)

### [Cube (1997)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/)

Like a Twilight Zone episode dreamed up by the likes Jorge Luis Borges, Canadian filmmaker Vincenzo Nataliâ€™s psychological thriller/horror/sci-fi pastiche is the ultimate in high-concept and low-budget.

A small group of strangers awaken in an elaborate prison maze of joining cubic cells that seem to go on to infinity, each with no memory of how they arrived in such strange perplexity. As they traverse the cube they soon find that each cell is booby-trapped, the meaning behind their impasse is scrutinized intelligently, and the allegorical and metaphysical payoff is as satiating as it is fist-pumping.
