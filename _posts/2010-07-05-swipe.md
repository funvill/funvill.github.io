<strong>How to Play</strong>
Each player starts with two dice and two chips.  When playing with 5 or 6 players each player starts with one die to start.

The game start with the youngest player rolling off of their dice.  Each die has five different values:
5-6 win a chip from the center
4 win a die from the center
3 lose a die to the center
2 swipe a die from any player
1 swipe a chip from any player

After rolling, the player does whatever the dice say.  The turn then passes to the player to the left.  It is important to note that a player cannot lose all of their dice; one is the fewest number of dice a player can have.  The game is over once all chips are won from the center.
