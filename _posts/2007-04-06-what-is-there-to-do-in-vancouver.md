Living in Vancouver I find myself asking the same question all too often.
What should I do in Vancouver? or What is going on this weekend in Vancouver?

I have made a pretty extensive list of <a href="/things-to-do-in-vancouver/">touristy places to visit in Vancouver</a> a few months ago but I still find my self asking the same questions. There is only so many times you can visit the <a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/home/">The Vancouver Aquarium</a> before you want to drown yourself.

So I have compiled this list of places that you can go and look to find something to do in Vancouver.

Vancouver has thousands of different restaurants to choose from and each week I try to go someplace new in this city (I create a reviews for every place I go to on <a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/profile.asp?u=3564">dinehere.ca</a>) Some other great Vancouver restaurant and eateries review sites include; <a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/">dinehere.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.urbandiner.inknoise.com/">urbandiner</a>, <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/">VanEats.com</a> <a href="http://www.vancouvercoffee.ca/">vancouvercoffee.ca</a>.

Vancouver has a pretty active music seen, and <a href="http://www.livemusicvancouver.com/">Livemusicvancouver.com</a> has a great list of upcoming shows in pubs, bars, and clubs around the city. There is also <a href="http://www.clubvibes.com/">Clubvibes</a>, <a href="http://www.clubzone.com/">Clubzone.com</a>.

Vancouver sometimes has special events but unless you read the paper every day you might not even hear anything about them until it is too late. Lucky there are a few events websites that can tell you what is coming and what you need to know about.  <a href="http://upcoming.org/metro/ca/bc/van/">Upcoming.org</a> is one of my favorite places, there is also <a href="http://www.vancouverevents.ca/" title="Last Updated: ">Vancouver Events</a> and <a href="http://www.straight.com/">straight.com</a>

Last but not least if you are still stuck for something to do try trolling some of the other Vancouver blogs out there.  My favorite Vancouver blogs are <a href="http://www.thevancouverite.com/">thevancouverite.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.beyondrobson.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Beyond  Robson</a>

I have found lots of other Vancouver blogs in no perpendicular order; <a href="http://gusf.blogspot.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Gus's  Place</a>, <a href="http://purrrlescence.blogspot.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Purrrlescence</a>, <a href="http://audihertz.net/blog/" title="Last Updated: ">John Bollwitt</a>, <a href="http://www.dingorue.com/" title="Last Updated: ">DingoRue</a>, <a href="http://www.megfowler.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Meg Fowler</a>, <a href="http://jnarvey.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Jonathon Narvey</a>, <a href="http://www.reallysmoothmusic.com/">Really Smooth  Music</a>, <a href="http://www.vancouverevents.ca/" title="Last Updated: ">Vancouver Events</a>, <a href="http://www.susannatalie.blogspot.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Susan  Natalie</a> ,<a href="http://blog.industrialbrand.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Industrial Brand Creative</a>, <a href="http://www.gusgreeper.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Gus Greeper</a>, <a href="http://www.miss604.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Miss 604</a>, <a href="http://blog.mikebrowne.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Mike Browne</a>, <a href="http://vanramblings.com/" title="Last Updated: ">VanRamblings</a>, <a href="http://vancouver.metblogs.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Metroblogging  Vancouver</a>, <a href="http://jakking.typepad.com/daily/" title="Last Updated: ">Jak's View From Van</a>, <a href="http://www.immutablyme.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Immutably Me</a>, <a href="http://kitsilano.typepad.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Kitsilano.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.publiceyeonline.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Public Eye  Online</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Urban Vancouver</a>,  <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Darren Barefoot</a>, <a href="http://www.breebop.com/" title="Last Updated: ">Breebop</a>, <a href="http://www.discovervancouver.com">discovervancouver.com</a> If you know of any other Vancouver blogs leave a comment and I will add it to my list.
