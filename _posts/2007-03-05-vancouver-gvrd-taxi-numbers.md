They can not refuse to pay with credit card, if there system is down they can Phone it in to the office. This is a scam to pocket the money from your card. <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/vancouver/2989104.html">Source</a>
If they say that they are going to take you to a debit machine to get money make sure that they turn off the timer first, how is it your fault that there system is down.
