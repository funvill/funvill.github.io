If you haven't already heard, Vancouver Maker Faire have an amazing venue in store for this year; we'll be in the <a href="http://vancouver.makerfaire.ca/vancouver-mini-maker-faire-in-2012-at-the-pne/" target="_blank">Forum building at the <strong>Pacific National Exhibition</strong></a> (PNE) on the weekend of June 23rd and 24th. This will give us 48,000 square feet of indoor space, and ample outdoor space too! Yes, forty eight thousand square feet of space to fill with amazing makers, doers, and creatives! It's going to be HUGE!

But that means <strong>we need Makers</strong>, and we need help spreading the word that <strong>the <a href="http://vancouver.makerfaire.ca/makers/" target="_blank">Call for Makers</a> is now open</strong>.
