<img class="size-medium wp-image-3495 alignright" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" alt="ShareMouse" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ShareMouse-300x67.png" width="300" height="67" />One of the many things that I can't stand about software is crap where. Crap wear lets you install it on your system saying its "100% free". When you get it configured and use it to the features it disables its self and gives you a pay wall. I have no problem with paying for software but when the developers out right lie to you I get pissed off.

ShareMouse keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com (no link love for you)Â andÂ Bartels Media produce crapwear. Beware of them, they make the world a worse place. They are BAD PEOPLE.

I found this software onÂ <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/maxivista/">http://alternativeto.net/software/maxivista/</a>.Â Now to spend the next few hours writing horrible reviews about this crap software on as many websites as I can find. Maybe I can outsource this task with virtual employee.
