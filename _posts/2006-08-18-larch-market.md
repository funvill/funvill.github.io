<strong>LARCH MARKET</strong>
A community bazaar

Enjoy the local flavour of a small (and incresingly rare) yuppie-free section of Kitsilano this Saturday.
Artists, musicians, students and chefs will be displaying a variety of treasures - books, records,
clothing, antiques, and more. Come early and chill out on the lawn, enjoy some good music, bask in the sun, and have a snack or two.

<strong>When:</strong> August 26th, 2006 (Saturday) 9:00am until 4:00pm
<strong>Where:</strong> Larch Street and 4th avenue, South Side

Parking is limited but the #4 or #7 stop right outside the block, and there's always tons of room for bikes!
