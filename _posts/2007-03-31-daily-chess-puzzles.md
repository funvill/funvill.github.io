<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/chess/" title="Chess Board"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/03/5_52_chessboard_chess3gif.gif" alt="Chess Board" align="right" /></a>I have created a script that generates a new chess puzzle from a database once a day. The puzzles can be email to you or you can subscribe via a RSS feed.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.abluestar.com/chess/"> A list of past chess puzzles</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/abluestar/chess">Subscribe to the chess puzzle a day RSS feed</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=819545">Subscribe to a chess puzzle a day mailing list</a></li>
</ul>
The script is still under heavy development any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Please feel free to <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/about/">contact me</a>.
