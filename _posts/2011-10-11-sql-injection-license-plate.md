With this in mind, he changed his license plate number to
<blockquote>('ZU 0666', 0, 0); Drop Database Table.</blockquote>
If the DMV uses this string of characters in their database lookup it has a good chance of deleting all of the database records containing his actual license plate number, ZU 0666. This has got to be 10 out of 10 on the creativity scale, and once again showing the importance of knowing what SQL injection and <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">little Bobby tables</a> is all about.
