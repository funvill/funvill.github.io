Sure, it's a school night, but with winter solstice and a new year upon us, what better time to gather your family and friends to see the moon in a new light?

Not only is is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> but its also the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice"> winter solstice</a>. The Hippies are going to be out in full force tonight. But they may have to compete with the <a href="http://www.evolver.net/user/justlive/blog/2012_or_2010">doom sayers</a> as they are predicting that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">Mayan calendar</a> may not have been 2012 but dec 21, 2010.

In Vancouver, BC  the lunar eclipse will happen at <em>10:33 PM</em>. I am planning on going to <a href="http://vancouver.ca/parks/parks/queenelizabeth/">Queen Elizabeth park</a> to watch it and freeze my ass off. Good times.
