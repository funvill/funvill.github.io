Normally I would go to my local electronics supply story, but this project requires lots (~64) of LEDs and my <a href="http://www.leeselectronic.com/">local electronics store</a> charges a premium for the LEDs, (@<a href="http://www.leeselectronic.com/product_info.php?products_id=9004">1.50 each</a>) and I know I can get them for cheaper then that.

<strong>What type of LED</strong>
<ul>
	<li>RGB LED Thou hole, I want to use the thou hole LEDs as they are a lot more durable then the SMT versions and last longer.</li>
	<li>Wide angle. I would like a ~100 degree viewing angle (its measured from the center of the LED, so it more like a 200 viewing angle) but these types of LEDs are hard to come by so I might have to settle with 60 degree viewing angle.</li>
	<li>30 mA or less at full brightness. The <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc5947.html">TLC5947</a> shift regulator chip that I am using supports a max of 30 mA and i am hoping to get a LED that uses less then that to prevent over heating.</li>
	<li>Diffused. I'm not sure why but all the<a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/minipov3/parts.html"> other POV projects</a> are using diffused LEDs. I have<a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/11790/what-makes-a-good-rgb-led"> asked a question</a> about this on <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/">electronics.stackexchange.com</a>. But for right now I will just follow conventional wisdom.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm">Common anode</a>. The <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc5947.html">TLC5947</a> chip we use is a sink driver and therefor requires common anode.</li>
</ul>
I searched online from a few retailers such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alibaba.com/">http://www.alibaba.com</a> (~$0.19) or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ledssuperbright.com/">http://ledssuperbright.com</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ledssuperbright.com/100-5mm-4-pin-rgb-led-4000-mcd-p-227">$0.35</a>) or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adafruit.com/">http://www.adafruit.com</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=302&amp;zenid=9d36137d8bb2f6da9071f934d4cd405f">$1.0</a>) or<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">http://www.sparkfun.com</a> (~<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9985">$0.6</a>) or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.digikey.com/">http://www.digikey.com</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;name=754-1492-ND">~$1.1</a>) or <a href="http://evilmadscience.com">evilmadscience.com</a> (<a href="http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/89-led#RGB">$0.40</a>)

I trust adafruit and sparkfun and have had good experiences from both of them in the past but I am worried that there is a such a huge range in price difference between each of these sites that I might be missing something critical. Again I asked more questions about the differences between different LEDs and <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/11790/what-makes-a-good-rgb-led">what makes a good RGB LED</a>.

I have ordered a few samples from different sites that supported free shipping, while I wait on a response to my questions.
