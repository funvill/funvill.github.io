This is the first<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC3YTZ2"> Geo Caches</a> that I have ever made. Created after the <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/2012/10/10/geo-caching-and-geo-coin-night/">Geo Cache info session at the Vancouver Hackspace</a>. I put it in an alley in the downtown east side near the entrance to the <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">Vancouver Hackspace</a>. It got approved on Saturday and has already been found by 4 people!
<blockquote>This cache can be found in one of the alleys of the downtone east side. The alley is decorated with a very nice mural of crows spray painted across the building. There are normally not a lot of people in this area and should be free of muggler. The container is a small, water proof magnetic box that has room for a few small items. It was created during a Geo Caching info session at The Vancouver HackSpace.
The location is next to the Vancouver hackspace;</blockquote>
