<img src="/public/uploads/Tetley_Beer_100.jpg" align="right" height="112" width="100" />While doing research for an article that I was writing on the drinking game <a href="/drinking-game-kings-cup/">King's cup</a>. I found that most drinking games all have the same sort of rules. Draw a card, roll a dice then follow the rule associated with that card or dice.

I started a collect all the drinking games rules that I could find that work with a "draw an item and follow the associated rule" type system. Then I put them all in a database and created a script to randomly generate a drinking game.

Feel free to make any suggestions
