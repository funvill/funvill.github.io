## One Line Pitch

A photo booth where the camera is only triggered when you scream loud enough. Producing a photo with real emotions.

## Description


<img src="/public/uploads/2023/screeming.png" alt="Screaming" style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/>Create a photo booth that is sound dampened. In the photo booth is a screen that shows the current viewfinder from the camera and a volume gauge, as well as some simple pictographic instructions. The camera only triggers if you scream loud enough.

This should reduce people's ability to try and look cute or presentable, and instead a more raw emotional state. Screaming can be exhilarating, especially since we are taught so often that we should be quiet and calm.

Afterwards I would print out the photo using a portable photo printer like [Canon SELPHY CP1000](https://en.canon-me.com/for_home/product_finder/printers/direct_photo/selphy_cp1000/)

## Prior art

I was able to find two simlare projects

- [Triggertrap Scream Photo Booth](https://tethertools.com/blog/create-a-wild-and-unique-event-experience-with-a-scream-photo-booth/)
- [Screamotron3000](https://petapixel.com/2012/06/13/scream-portraits-shot-using-a-photo-booth-triggered-by-sound/)

## Market

This would be a good idea for a maker faire or a festival
