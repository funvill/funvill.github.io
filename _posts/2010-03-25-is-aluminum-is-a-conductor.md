<strong>YES</strong>

All metals are conductive to electricity. If you mean conductive to heat, every material is conductive to heat...it just depends how much. Aluminum is one of the best conductors of heat. Most electronics-oriented heat sinks are made out of aluminum, because it transfers heat so well.
