<h2><strong>Stick it to the Streets</strong></h2>
<a href="http://www.vancouverpublicspace.ca/">VPSN</a> is gathering a large group of people wandering the street with noise makers making a lot of noise/"Music", from downtown to GasTown. its too bad they didn't go thou <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaletown">YaleTown</a> with all the people that bitch continually about <a href="http://vancouver.ca/police/policeboard/agenda/2007/070418/0721RPM.pdf">noise violation</a> [PDF].
<blockquote>How much music can be made with a pair of drumsticks and the street as the instrument? The Vancouver Public Space Network and friends will be descending on to Granville Street this June to <a href="http://www.vancouverpublicspace.ca/index.php?page=139">Stick It to the Streets</a> and find out. Bring your drumsticks, spoons, keys, and selves to join a crew of Vancouverites as they move through the city making music with the urban landscape. Will we expect impromptu drum battles? Spontaneous street dancing? Come down and see for yourself!</blockquote>

<h2>Vancouver Car free day 2010</h2>
Last weekend was <a href="http://www.carfreevancouver.org/">Vancouver car free day</a>, where Main street and commercial drive are shut down for the day and filled with vendors and pedestrians in a celerberation of alternative means of transport and other things.

I made a small time laps video from a friends roof of the street. Unfortunately the batteries in my camera died after 2 hours and the part of the street that I was taking pictures of wasn't that interesting and it was still early in the day so there wasn't too many people out but at least the picture quality is good.
