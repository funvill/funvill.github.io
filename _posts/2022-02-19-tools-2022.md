Everyday I use a series of tools that make my life easier. These tool change and morph each year. This is my most up-to-date list of recommended tools and equipment.

Previous snapshots of my tools and equipment lists can be found here: [2021](/current-tools-and-equipment-2021), [2018](/tools-2018), [2016](/tools-2016)

Inspired by [UsesThis.com](https://usesthis.com/) - A collection of interviews asking people from all walks of life, what they use to get the job done.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [*Steven Smethurst*](/about) and live two lives. During the day I am a CTO at [Chipkin Automation Systems](http://store.chipkin.com/) and at night I am a maker, hacker and artist. You can find more about me and my projects on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/funvill) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/funvill).

## What has changed since 2021

The biggest change since [2021](/year-in-review-2022) is that I moved to a new house with more space and a seperate home office.

I stopped subscribing to Netflix after they started cracking down on [Netflix account sharing passwords canada](https://globalnews.ca/news/9470991/netflix-account-sharing-passwords-canada/). With the fragmation of streaming services, piracy has become more appealing.

I made my own version of [Simone Giertz](https://www.simonegiertz.com/)'s [Every Day Calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar) called [monthly habit tracker](/projects/2022-monthly-habit-tracker/).

## What would be your dream setup?

I been dreaming of becoming a digital nomad and traveling the world while working. Reducing my footprint of gear to just what fits within a single suitcase  appeals to me. I am planning on significantly reducing my equipment and stuff over the next few years in an effort to become more mobile.
