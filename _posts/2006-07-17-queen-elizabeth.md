The top of this beautifully maintained 52 hectare (130 acre) park is the highest point in the city, at 167m (505 ft) above sea level. From the lookouts, visitors have a 360 degree view of the Vancouver skyline. The park receives nearly 6 million visitors a year who marvel at its superior standard of garden plantings.

A former stone quarry, the park was developed in the 1950s to include a pitch &amp; putt golf course, paths and display gardens, and a large arboretum. The Bloedel Conservatory geodesic dome was added in 1969.

The Celebration Pavilion at Queen Elizabeth Park is presently under construction. This stunning covered facility is a perfect spot for wedding ceremonies, renewal of vows, memorials, baptisms, reunions, receptions, corporate events, meetings and more.
