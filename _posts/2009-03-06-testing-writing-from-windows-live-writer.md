<p><strong>Push for web apps      <br /></strong>Currently there is a real push for everything to work in a browser, thin clients. For example; Email, Word processors (like Google docs), calendars, contact lists, router administration ect. It makes sense since everyone has a browsers, they all work relatively the same and its cross platform, plus its available anywhere there is a internet connection. With Google Gears (and Yahoo whatever?) these browser apps can work offline as well as online. </p>  <p><strong>Not for every situation </strong>    <br />As much as I like thin web apps, I still want a desktop client. My Blog is a perfect example, I won&quot;t write new posts unless I have a desktop client. The tiniest little bit of extra effort I have to put in to login to the online services usually deters me from making updates. I also never write a post in one sitting, usually I will have 5-10 drafts that I add to over the day. When ever I finish a post a schedule it for the next day incase I think of anything else to add to it. Its just harder to do that with a online app. </p>  <p><strong>Enter Windows Live Writer      <br /></strong>Today a friend suggested I try €œ<em>Windows Live Writer</em>€ a desktop blog client that works with Wordpress. I have tried many different desktop clients before and have always left wanting. But so far it seems pretty decent. </p>  <p><strong>Why I Like it </strong></p>  <ul>   <li><strong>It works with wordpress</strong> - not only does it work with wordpress but it works well, it downloads all the categories/tags so i don&quot;t have to enter them manually.&#160; <ul>       <li>You can also add new categories from the client. </li>        <li>Set the publish date </li>        <li>and other wordpress features. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><strong>Live preview</strong> - You can preview a post with your current theme before you post it, from with in the client. </li>    <li><strong>You can edit the source</strong> - I&quot;m shocked on how many desktop clients don&quot;t have this simple option. </li>    <li><strong>Simple interface</strong> - So simple my parents could use it </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>     <br />I&quot;m going to try it out for a few weeks and see how it goes, So far I'm pretty impressed. </p>
