I picked up a used [Wanhao Duplicator i3](https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/wanhao-duplicator-i3) from a friend for a good price. I have used 3D printers in the past, but I have never owned one before. Having one at my house allows me to run really long print jobs (+20 hours). The interesting thing about the Wanhao Duplicator i3 is that it allows me to [print exotic filaments](https://all3dp.com/best-3d-printer-filament-types-pla-abs-pet-exotic-wood-metal/) like [ninja flex](http://ninjaflex3d.ca/), PETG, nylon, wood, etc. 

I decided to use [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software) at the recommendation of [John Biehler](http://johnbiehler.com/) *A local 3D printing genius*. Cura is the software for slicing my 3D models into GCode. Its works great and is much easier than other applications that I have used in the past. It also includes the ability to add 3rd party plugins to add new features. 

I joined a helpful [facebook group for the Wanhao Duplicator i3](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WanhaoDi3/) that I have been asking lots of questions as I slowly figure this printer out. 

As I find more information I updated my [3D printer resources](/alternatives-to-the-vancouver-hackspace#d-printing) list. 

## 3D printing FAQ 

**Q1) Do different manufacturers of filament require different temperatures for the same type of filament (PLA)?**

Yes they do, manufacturers almost never give you pure filament. Normally it is doped with other things in an attempt to make a better filament. Even within the same manufacturer and plastic, different colors can require differing temperatures.
