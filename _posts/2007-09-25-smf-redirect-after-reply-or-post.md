I just installed <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/">Simple machine forum</a> (SMF) over at <a href="http://www.everydayfiction.com/forums/">EveryDayFiction.com</a>.
it works great but it has had a few odd quirks including;

Every time you created topic or replyed to a post it sent you back to the board index instead of the topic.
it took me a while to figure out why this was happening and I thought I would share my solution with you.

Its a OPTION for your users, the default is set to return the user to the board index after a post.
You can change the option from your admin control panel.

Go to Admin-&gt;Themes and Layout-&gt;Reset Options and click on:
Reset default (guest) options for this theme

If Return to topics after posting by default is not set, change it to enable it now.

Go back to Reset Options and do the same for:
Reset all members' current options for this them
