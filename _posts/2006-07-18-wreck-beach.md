This 7.8 kilometers long wilderness-like beach, which follows a promontory below an emerald-green forested, 200-foot high, cliff system weathered to beauty akin the White cliffs of Dover, is Canada's first and largest, legal, clothing-optional beach and is a Mecca to visitors from around the world!
