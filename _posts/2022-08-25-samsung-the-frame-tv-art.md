I created a [Gallery](/ArtSamsungTheFrameTV/) of AI/ML generated artwork for the The [Samsung 'The Frame' TV](https://www.samsung.com/ca/lifestyle-tvs/the-frame/). All the artwork in this gallery was generated by me using [Mid Journey](https://www.midjourney.com/) and has been resized to 3840×2160 or [16:9 aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16:9_aspect_ratio) [4K UHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#4K_UHD). The artwork is free to download and use on your own TV and is released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Samsung 'The Frame' TV requires a very specific resolution of 3840×2160 for custom artwork that you load onto the TV. If the resolution of the image is off by single pixel, even if the ratio (16:9), it will put a 'mat border' around the artwork. I find that the mat border less appealing.

I was having a problem finding artwork that fit this specifc 16:9 ratio but with the help of [Mid Journey](https://www.midjourney.com/) I was able to generate a series of photos with the specific resolution for the TV.

I created this project primarily to learn [NuxtJS framework](https://nuxtjs.org/), and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and to share the images I created using [Mid Journey](https://www.midjourney.com/) for the [Samsung 'The Frame' TV](https://www.samsung.com/ca/lifestyle-tvs/the-frame/).
