I found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diatom/sketchchair-furniture-designed-by-you">SketchChair</a> while looking for CNC related projects on Kickstarter. It is an <a href="http://sketchchair.cc/">open source application</a> that you can use to draw chairs and output the design files for cutting on a CNC or laser cutter.

They have an <a href="http://sketchchair.cc/designs">design library</a> of chairs that other people have made using the application. I downloaded a few of them, resized the chairs to work with paper as a test. The modified design files can be found in <a href="https://github.com/funvill/Laser-furniture/tree/master/SketchChair">laser-furniture</a> repo on my github account.
