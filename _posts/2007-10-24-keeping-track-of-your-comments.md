One problem i have is that while i am browsing around the internet making comments on peoples blogs i often forgot to check back in a week to see if there are any responses.

Some people have 'Subscribe to comments via email' plugin installed but it dosn't work one blogs that get 100+ comments per post.
<h3>Subscribe to comments via email</h3>
This is a popular solution for many web site developers, its a little check box at the bottom of each post that lets your users get a email notification automatically when ever someone replies to the post. Easly installed on most blogging platforms with a plugin.

<strong>The Advantages  </strong>
Easy install, Simple for the users.

<strong>The Disadvantage  </strong>
It can get annoying to get 100+ comments on a post that is very popular.
<h3>coComment.com</h3>
There is also online service called <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment.com</a> that tries to create a list of all your online conversations. It works by installing a browser plug-in that checks the pages for certain HTML elements and inserts a coComments bar. When you post a comment on a supported blogging platform such as Wordpress, Blogger, Flicker, Digg, Type pad, <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/supported">and others</a> it copies the comment and adds it to your <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/funvill">online profile</a>. When someone replies to the post you are altered with a icon in your browser.

<strong>The Advantage
</strong>It creates a clean easy to read list of posts where there have been replies since you last made a comment, and its dead simple to use.

<strong>The Disadvantage </strong>
The problem is that it doesn't always work, for me it worked about 80% of the time but not all the time.
<h3></h3>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

There is no prefect solution that I can find for keeping track of all your comments but coComments is probably the easiest one to use even if it doesn't work all the time.
