Yet another [brain dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dump) post. (*brain dump:* snapshot of the internal state of a knowledge database for transfer or archiving purposes).

I am changing the format of the brain dumps to be more journal like instead of a list of links as in the previous versions.

## Birding

At the end of 2020, my partner purchased a [Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary Lens for Canon EF](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1082154-REG/sigma_150_600mm_f_5_6_3_dg_os.html) so she could do some wildlife photography while at her new job. I have been borrowing it on my days off from work to take photos of birds. I have since become completely enamored with birdwatching. If you told me 2 years ago before the COVID-19 pandemic that I would become a birder I would not have believed you.

I have turned birding into a project for 2021. The plan is to get 52 good print quality photos of birds and make a standard deck of playing cards with photos of birds on the faces. Each card will have some information about the birds to help people identify them in the wild. Afterward, I will get the deck printed and send them to my friends and family as gifts.

I thought it was going to take me a year to get all the photos but I have already gotten 35 print quality photos, seen 57 different species of birds, and taken close to ~3,000 photos. At this rate, I should be done by end of March 2021

I have been tracking the species of birds using my [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=funvill&verifiable=any) account. I have been posting the best photos on my Instagram feed ([@funvill](https://www.instagram.com/funvill/)). Follow me to keep up to date with this project.

I have been using [iBird Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatbird.pro&hl=en_US&gl=US) and [Merlin Bird ID](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labs.merlinbirdid.app&hl=en_US&gl=US) by Cornell Lab as my field guides for helping identify birds. I found this website to be a good source of [bird photography how-tos and guides](https://www.audubon.org/photography/how-tos).

Some of my favorite photos so far are:
- [Hooded Merganser catching a gunnel fish](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69287113)
- [Juvenile bald eagles fighting](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69241646)
- [Juvenile bald eagles hunting and catching ducks](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69241645)
- [Pelagic Cormorant catching a gunnel fish](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69029307)
- [Northern Flicker watching me watching him](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69030257)
- [Belted Kingfisher](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/68526939) looking majestic.

## Pen Plotting
[Plotter Twitter pen pals](https://twitter.com/BoldMachines/status/1354191730640379907) is a project where people send each other drawings made from a plotter. I have been getting more interested in plotters and CNC over the past few years and this kind of project speaks to me. To find good plotter designs follow the hashtag [#plottertwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter) on Twitter.

- [sphericons](https://github.com/abw/sphericons) models that can be used with a CNC or a 3D printer.  Sphericons Rolls in a [Wibbly Wobbly Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpkDs6oRw_I)

## Other

- [What are some good utilities/tools that you don't think other people know about?](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1312866698941300738). I always like these crowdsourced lists of tools. They are good for discovering new tools.
- [How to Rebuild our World from Scratch](http://the-knowledge.org/en-gb/the-book/) is a book with all the knowledge, designs, plans that you would need to rebuild society.
- [Line to map](https://lines.chromeexperiments.com/) - Draw a line on the screen and a matching map contour will be produced.
