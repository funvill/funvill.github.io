Just one more reason why paypal sucks
<blockquote>so, it seems that after 5 months of accepting donations via paypal, they have decided to freeze our account. as you may know, we are applying for non-profit status for the Flux Foundation with the intention of building community through art with the Temple of Flux and beyond. As a pending non-profit, it is within our legal right to accept donations as long as donors are informed of that status.

I just wish there was a better (generality accepted)  alternative. Maybe <a href="https://www.wepay.com/">WePay</a>

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Update:</span></strong> It looks like Paypal let them get there money out but <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1680570/burning-man-defeat-paypal">only after a lot of bad press</a>.
