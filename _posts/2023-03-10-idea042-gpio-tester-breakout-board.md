## One Line Pitch

A 8 position dip switches breakout board

## Description

<img src="/public/uploads/2023/dip_switches2.png" alt="dipswitches" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/>I have been developing some electronic boards using development boards. It would be useful for my current project to have a breakout board that can be used for GPIO testing

There would be 8 switches that have the following states

- High - Connected to VIN
- Low - Connected to GND

[A6S-8104-H](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/A6S-8104-H/1506401), Digi-Key Part Number: SW1017-ND

Each switch connect to a pin header, VIN, GND

Boring little device but it would have saved me a couple hours of testing this week.

## Prior art

- [PMOD DIP Switch](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/fpga/products/pmod-dip-switch) - Exactly what I am looking for. Just buy this instead.
