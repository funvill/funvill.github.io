## One Line Pitch

Give Vancouver its own unique tone by installing wind chime like devices in the trees across the city

## Description

Many cities around the world have their own special tone. It's normally caused by the wind flowing through a city in such a way that creates vibrations that give the city a tone. Normally in older cities with more haphazard layout of the skyscrapers.

Vancouver doesn’t have a tone, maybe because it's not very windy here, or the buildings are built in a grid, or some other unknown variable. The closest thing vancouver has is the sound of the [SkyTrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyTrain_(Vancouver))

In this project we give Vancouver a tone. A small device that is cheap and self contained. It should be able to be tossed up into the branches of one of the many trees on boulevards around Vancouver. High enough that it would take a ladder or special equipment to remove it. It should produce sound by itself, self-contained. Either wind powered, or solar, or maybe a small battery that would last a few months to a year.

### Using Wind

- Wind Chimes would work, The clattering of the hollow wood tubes.
- A Wind Flute would work too, a small pipe made of PVC piping, with a specific cut into it so that it makes a specific note.
- [Wooden wind whistles](https://www.instructables.com/Make-your-own-whistle/) can be made of scrap wood and only take 3 steps to make
- A water whistle would also work, It rains enough to fill the reservoir and as wind goes across its mouthpiece it would create a tone.
- [Wind Hooters](https://www.instructables.com/Wind-Hooters-for-your-Yard/) are a little more complex to make but can be done with recycled materials.
- [Obnoxious Noise Maker](https://www.instructables.com/Really-Obnoxious-Noise-Maker/) - A rubber band, plastic bag and a bit of PVC pipe

### Batteries included

I don’t like the idea of using things with batteries as the batteries will eventually leak and cause problems for the environment.

- [Miniature Beeping Circuit Prank] - Beeps every few mins, and the batteries last 2-3 years from a coin cell. Costs less $1 in parts. The sound isn’t what I am looking for. It's more annoying than anything else.
- Solar powered radio with speakers - It would take about 15 mins of direct sun to power the radio for about 3 mins. It could be tuned to a local radio station. This would be more expensive then most of the other ideas at $10 CAD. So maybe making a DIY version without a case, then coat it with water sealant would reduce the cost

## Prior art

- [What is the sound of a city? A wail, a thrum, a rustle](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-urban-sound-noise-maps-spring-perspec-0414-jm-20160412-story.html) 
- [Chatty Maps](http://goodcitylife.org/chattymaps/)
- [How to sound map a city](https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/10/sound-map-city-part-one/)

## Market

If I were ever to do this I am pretty sure I would be murdered by just about every group. Making trash and thoughting it in trees, the annoyance of the sound, the possible damage to wildlife with the new noise. Etc… This is a particularly bad idea.

Market = No one
