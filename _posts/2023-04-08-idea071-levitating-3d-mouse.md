## One Line Pitch

Using magnets coils to levitate the mouse in the air, and 9 degrees of freedom sensors to detect motion

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\magnetic-levitation-plant.png' alt='magnetic-levitation-plant' style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px" >When designing 3D models it can be useful to use a 3D mouse to easily navigate in 3D space. These tend to look like a joystick that allows for pushing in and out for zoning, and twisting left and right rotation.

What I propose is to use two magnetic coils to levitate a cube in space. This is commoditized already and you often see it in levitating potted air plants.

The cube has an embedded accelerator and gyro in it with 9 degrees of freedom. When a user rotates the cube in space the motion is wirelessly transmitted to a virtual 3D mouse that can be used in CAD application. The cube is powered by coil transmitting power wirelessly (Already done)

Basically combining three existing technologies together.

## Prior art

- [Project McFly](https://www.razer.com/project-mcfly) - April fools joke by Razer
- [The Bat](https://www.kibardindesign.com/products/in-progress/the-bat-levitating-kibardin/) - It holds a mouse in the air for storage not use.

## Market

People who work a lot in CAD
