The founder of the <a href="http://schooloffishfoundation.org/">School of Fish Foundation</a>, Shannon Ronalds, is working to create a positive impact on the seafood industry by educating chefs about sustainable seafood. He had a vision to build the floating dining room and new that plastic 2-Liter bottles could be used as flotation. With the help of a marine engineer and <a href="http://www.goodweather.ca/index.php?/projects/pop-bottle-barge/#1005476/-Pop-Bottle-Barge-1-Vancouver">Goodweather Design</a>, they drew up plans for a dining room that floats using 1,672 bottles. The elegant raft was constructed out of reclaimed pinewood. All materials going into and coming out of this floating dining room are renewable, recycled, reclaimed and/or repurposed.
