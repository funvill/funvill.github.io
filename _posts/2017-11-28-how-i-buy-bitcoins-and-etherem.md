A few months ago I started to play around with Crypto-Currency such as [Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/) and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/). Mostly to understand the [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and because of [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) (Fear of missing out) on the price increase. Today 1 BTC == $10,000 USD. Over the last four weeks my investment/gambling has increased 110%. As the price keeps climbing up I been getting excited about it and telling people. One of the most common questions I get is how to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

There are plenty of [guides on how to buy Crypto-Currency](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/canada/) on the internet. This is how I was able to do it. 

* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a1e19c52e72ae0261a0ada2) - Accepts credit cards or debit cards, signup takes less then 30 mins, fast, fees 3.99%, works with Canadian dollars. This is normally how I demo how Ethereum works because of how fast it is to get going. Max funding per week is around ~$500 CAD. 
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) - These are random people that can sell you bitcoins in your currency. The coins are stored in escrow while the transaction takes place. [localbitcoins takes around 1%](https://localbitcoins.com/fees) and the person normally has a premium of around 10-15%. I have used this method to do Interac e-transfer a few times. Account signup is simple and should take you less then 30 mins to get bitcoins into your wallet. 
* [Quadrigacx](https://www.quadrigacx.com/?ref=gz6esya7sjsqtcgp3q7gh0cs) - This is an actual exchange and gets the better rates then the other methods. It took me about a week to get it all setup with all the verification steps. They accept INTERAC Online. Fees 1.5% with a Min $5 CAD. It can take up to a day for the funds to arrive in your account.
