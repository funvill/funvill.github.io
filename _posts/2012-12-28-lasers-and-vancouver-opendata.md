A few days ago I attended a talk at the <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">Vancouver HackSpace</a> (VHS) on using <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/2012/11/29/open-data-and-lasers-at-vhs-thursday-dec-13th/">Open Data and lasers</a> to make interesting wooden maps.

<a href="http://denimandsteel.com/talks/polyglot/">The talk</a> revolved around <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill studio</a> and how to style maps using a CSS variant then you could export them as SVG files (vector image). Once the image has been saved as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG file</a> it can be imported in to <a href="http://inkscape.org/">InkScape</a>, cleaned up and then saved as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF">DFX file</a> for the laser cuter.

These maps took about 2 hrs each to cut and look amazing. This is a map of all the Vancouver roads and parks.

The problems with these maps is that I only used 1/16th inch wood. The wood bowed and twisted significantly. To flatten it out, I had to soak the map in water for an hour then stack books on top of it. Next time I think i will use thicker wood 1/8th or 1/4th

The maps are also very busy, with lots of lines. The next time I do this I will make a map with less lines. maybe just the parks or the bike lanes, ect..
