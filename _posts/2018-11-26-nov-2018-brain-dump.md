## Other 

- [Print a map on a mug](https://anvaka.github.io/map-print/) - [Github](https://github.com/anvaka/map-print)

- [GoTenna](https://www.gotenna.com/) - Off network mesh networking that connects to your phone with bluetooth for input. I have made something simlare with ESP32s but this commercial product does it even better. 

- [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) -  known in English as the Way of Saint James among other names, is a network of pilgrims' ways or pilgrimages leading to the shrine of the apostle Saint James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where tradition has it that the remains of the saint are buried. Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. It is also popular with hiking and cycling enthusiasts and organized tour groups.

## Resources for Islamic Geometric Design

- [Drawing Geometry](https://www.amazon.ca/Drawing-Geometry-Artists-Designers-Architects/dp/0863156088) by Jon Allen - This book teaches how to construct all of the basic polygons (that are necessary in all geometric design), using a compass and a straight edge. It doesn't however teach much about how to physically use a compass, which is unfortunate. There may be videos online about that, or I could show you in person, if you wanted to book a private lesson.

- [Islamic Geometric Patterns](https://www.amazon.ca/Islamic-Geometric-Design-Eric-Broug/dp/0500516952) by Eric Broug - This is an essential beginner book. It has simple to follow instructions and enough patterns to get you started. Eric's second book has patterns as well, and is also a great addition.

- [Arts and Crafts of the Islamic Lands](https://www.amazon.ca/Arts-Crafts-Islamic-Lands-Principles/dp/0500517029) by Khaled Azzam - This book is essentially an introduction to the Prince's School of Traditional Arts curriculum. It has patterns, shows various sub grids, and demonstrates many ways to utilize Islamic Geometric design. 

- [Arabesques. Decorative Art in Morocco](https://www.amazon.com/Arabesques-Decorative-Jean-Marc-Castera/dp/2867701244) by Jean Marc Castera - This book explains a simplified way to design Moroccan style Islamic Geometric designs. It is an absolute gem of a book, and is certainly my favourite. However, it is a simplified beginners book (which has you using a grid method, which is not 100% accurate, but is still fantastic), which is great when you're a beginner, but it's not going to get you to the pro level.
