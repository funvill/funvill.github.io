I stumbled on to "<a href="http://pwdbp.com/?action=5364.showPerson">Lee Krasnow</a>" work from a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/05/make_podcast_lee_krasnow_makes.html">MAKE pod cast</a> that I have included below.

I have always loved these types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle">puzzles</a>, ring puzzles, box puzzles, ball puzzles. Each year my family would give me a bunch of them for xmas/birthday/etc. 10-15 new puzzles each year some are pretty complex but i have never seen anything as complicated as Lee Krasnow's <a href="http://pwdbp.com/?action=5386.showDesign">Barcode Burr</a>.
<blockquote><a href="http://blog.abluestar.com/public/uploads/2007/11/dsc04935.jpg" title="Barcode Burr"><img src="http://blog.abluestar.com/public/uploads/2007/11/dsc04935.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Barcode Burr" align="right" /></a>With so many possible ways to notch the pieces (each of which would yield a different puzzle solving experience) Lee Krasnow decided to design the notches of the Barcode Burr so that the pieces moved in a binary progression. This means that when all six pieces are retracted, the first move is to extend piece #1 which will then allow piece #2 to extend. Once #2 is extended, #1 must be pushed back in before #3 may extend. Because #3 is extended, #4 is now able to move, but not until #2 gets pushed back in place. Of course #2 cannot move until #1 is extended again, and then once this happens #1 must be pushed back in before #4 can finally move.</blockquote>
I didn't see a price tag on the <a href="http://pwdbp.com/?action=5386.showDesign">Barcode Burr</a> but I expect it to be pretty damn expensive.
