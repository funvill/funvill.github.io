This weekend we built a IPod amplifier to power a small 8ohm speaker for an art project that one of my good friends was doing. Her project involved a metal sculpture that speak a manifiesto to anyone that walked in front of it.

I found the Amp Schematic in the latest <a href="http://makezine.com/09/">MAKE magazine 09</a> - <a href="http://makezine.com/09/crackerboxamp/">The $5 Cracker box amplifier</a>.

It ended up costing closer to $20 CAN in parts because when you buy capacitor and resistor you have to buy them in bundles packages of 20 or so. In the end I have enough spare parts to build 5 of these amps for $20.

With the help of of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54804764@N00/401719542/">this diagram</a> it should be too hard to figure out what to do. I probably would not have gotten it working with out that diagram.

Instead of using a 1/4  mono phone jack I used a mono head phone jack that connects easily to my IPod. I removed the potentiometer, it just isn't needed for a IPod amp.
