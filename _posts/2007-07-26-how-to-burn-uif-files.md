The .UIF or Universal Image Format File was created by MagicISO as a compressed ISO file.

An ISO image (.iso) is a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. More loosely, it refers to any optical disc image,

You will need two pieces of software, one to decompress the .UIF file to an ISO and the other to burn the ISO.

To Convert the UFI file to an ISO you will need to download <a href="http://www.magiciso.com/">MagicISO</a>. MagicISO is not free but there is a trial that will allow you to decompress a UFI file to a slightly larger ISO file.  If you do feel like spending a little money MagicISO can also burn UFI files if you pay for it.

To Burn an ISO I suggest that you use <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> its free and simple to use.

<strong>Directions</strong>
