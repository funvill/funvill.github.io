Set out the glasses in a line, arrange them from 1-6.
First person rolls the dice, whatever number comes up, that&quot;s the glass they fill up with WHATEVER concoction they want, anything goes.  Next person rolls; if they roll on the glass which is filled, they have to down it and roll again in order to fill up a different glass.  The game continues, every time it&quot;s your turn you have to fill up a glass, this can mean that you have to down all six glasses before you land on an empty one.
