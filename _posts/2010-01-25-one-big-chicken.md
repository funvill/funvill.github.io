One Big Chicken is a drinking game.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 or more people</li>
	<li>beer</li>
	<li>at least one person that knows all ten phrases</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
The person who knows all the phrases begins one phrase a time.
The game follows the same routine as the Twelve Days of Christmas.  So, the sixth person in the circle would have to say the sixth phrase as well as the previous five.

If you mess up a phrase you drink the number of phrases you had to complete, and then start over at the first phrase.  This continues until the game is completed by saying all ten without screwing it up royally.

The phrases are:
Big Chicken
Cute Ducks
Brown Bears
Hairy Running Hares
Fat Females Sitting, Sipping scotch, and smoking cigarettes
Sheets Slit by Sam the Sheet Slitter
Sexy Siamese Sailors sailing the seven seas
Echoing egotists echoing egotistical ecstasies
Naughty Knocked up Nuns navigating the nigerian desert towards the nunnery
fig pluckers plucking figs, I&quot;m not a fig plucker or a fig pluckers son but I&quot;ll pluck figs until the fig plucking&quot;s done!

I have played this game many times.  Not many people ever get past 5.  It's a good way to start the night.
You could also make up your own phrases, comment with any suggestions that you might have.
