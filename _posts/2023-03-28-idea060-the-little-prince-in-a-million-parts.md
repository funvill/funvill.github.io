## One Line Pitch

Layered paper craft light boxes of the different chapters of The Little Prince

## Description

This idea is based on [Idea 58 - In a million parts](/idea058-a-quotable-book-in-a-million-parts/). Of splitting a written work into many parts and making transformative art from each part.

<img src="/public/uploads/2023/littleprince-layers.png" alt="littleprince-layers" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/>The book [The Little Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) by [Antoine de Saint-Exupéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry) and subsequent movie [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEPqgSNLfK8). The Little Prince has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.  The book was illustrated using watercolors by Saint-Exupéry.

I have wonderful memories of this book as a child. A book that formed my childhood and outlook on society and life. I have very strong feelings about this book and I assume others do as well.

The book could be split up by chapter or by each of the planets that the little prince visits.

Each layer could have a different color to add depth to the frame. Maybe use semi transparent paper to allow the light to leak between each layer. The size of the project would be built around the cutting area of the [K40 laser cutter](https://all3dp.com/2/k40-laser-cutters-all-you-need-to-know/) or the [cricut paper cutter](https://cricut.com/en-ca/)
