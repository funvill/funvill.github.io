## One Line Pitch

A “Where’s Waldo” hunt and search photo book that teaches people how to ID local species of birds.

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\wheres-wren.png' alt='bird, wren, Wearing a Wheres waldo red and white striped bobble hat, horizontal stripes, vector, cartoon, in a cafe' title='bird, wren, Wearing a Wheres waldo red and white striped bobble hat, horizontal stripes, vector, cartoon, in a cafe' style="float: right; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px">[Where's waldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F) (aka Where's Wally?) style search and find photo books but instead of searching for Waldo, you search for a specific bird with a Waldo style red and white striped [bobble hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knit_cap).

This book is directed at bird nerds, birders, and people who want to be able to ID bird species. Each book is for a specific geographical location, and the book is filled with all the birds that can be found in that location.

The primary goal is to ID the special Wren wearing a red and white striped bobble hat. The readers can also ID all the other species of birds in the photo as well. This can be used sort of like a flash card for bird species. While there male and female of each species in the area, the page is mostly covered with Wren not wearing the red and white striped bobble hat. Look-a-likes but not quite the right one. This should give a bunch of false positives for the people just like a normal Where's Waldo style book.

Maybe instead of each book being called "Where's Wren?", we could have a series of different books all with a pun with alliteration in the name.

I think bird nerds would get a kick out of this book. It's a way to hopefully share their joy of birding with the next generation
