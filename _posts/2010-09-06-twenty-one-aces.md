	<li>2 or more players</li>
	<li>A few different types of liquor (you can play with one but its not as fun)</li>

<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
Each player takes a turn rolling five dice.
The number of Aces (1s) are counted.
Once a player rolls the 7th Ace they decide what the shot will be.
The player that rolls the 14th Ace pays for it.
The player that rolls the 21st Ace drinks it.

One die is taken out of play for each Ace rolled over the 17th Ace until only one die is left.

The game could be shortened by rolling more dice or by selecting different key numbers(7,14,21) numbers.
