One of my good friends just had a child and I wanted to get them a hand made gift. I decided on making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_(sculpture)">mobile</a> with VHS's laser cutter.

The first version I designed while at VHS one night.

<a href="/public/uploads/2013/02/mobile.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3175" alt="mobile" src="/public/uploads/2013/02/mobile-300x264.png" width="300" height="264" /></a> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3176" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" alt="2013-02-20 00.39.05" src="/public/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20-00.39.05-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />

I changed a few things in Version two. I added more rings, designed in holes for the strings  instead of doing it manually drilling them afterwards, I also painted the rings as well.

<a href="/public/uploads/2013/02/mobile_v2.png"><img alt="mobile_v2" src="/public/uploads/2013/02/mobile_v2-300x180.png" width="300" height="180" /></a><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3177" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" alt="2013-02-22 16.43.05" src="/public/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-22-16.43.05-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />

For the next version I think I am going to put the death star in the center and use starwars  icons.
