Over the last few months all I have been hearing about is <a href="http://www.agloco.com/r/BBFJ0259">AGLOCO</a>.

As I understand it, its a tool bar for your browser that monitors what you search for and replaces ads with there own and you get a share of the income. This is nothing new but it hasn't been around since the dot come crash.

They don't pay you for clicking on ads so the advertisers might actually get some value from this service unlike the ones from 1996. Since the users get no benifit from constantly clicking ads, the users should in theory only click ads that have value to them all so known as good leads.

<a href="http://www.agloco.com/r/BBFJ0259">AGLOCO</a> goes to great lengths to help you get as many people signed up as possible by paying you a referral commission and creating forum letters for you to send to all your friends and family. They also give you a nifty grafic that shows your referral count.

Its an interesting service and I plan on trying it out for a few weeks to see how it goes.
Feel free to sign up underneath me and help me make some coins.
Who knows you might make some money too.

<strong>Referral form  letter: </strong>
<blockquote>Dear reader,
I recently joined <a href="http://www.agloco.com/r/BBFJ0259">AGLOCO</a> because of a friend recommended it to me. I am now promoting it to you because I like the idea and I want you to share in what I think will be an exciting new Internet concept.AGLOCO&quot;s story is simple:

Do you realize how valuable you are? Advertisers, search providers and online retailers are paying billions to reach you while you surf.  How much of that money are you making? NONE!

AGLOCO thinks you deserve a piece of the action.

AGLOCO collects money from those companies on behalf of its members. (For example, Google currently pays AOL 10 cents for every Google search by an AOL user. And Google still has enough profit to pay $1.6 billion dollars for YouTube, an 18-month old site full of content that YouTube&quot;s users did not get paid for!

AGLOCO will work to get its Members their share of this and more.

AGLOCO is building a new form of online community that they call an Economic Network. They are not only paying Members their fair share, but they&quot;re building a community that will generate the kind of fortune that YouTube made. But instead of that wealth making only a few people rich, the entire community will get its share.

What's the catch? No catch - no spyware, no pop-ups and no spam - membership and software are free and AGLOCO is 100% member owned. Privacy is a core value and AGLOCO never sells or rents member information.

So do both of us a favor: Sign up for AGLOCO right now! If you use this link to sign up, I automatically get credit for referring you and helping to build AGLOCO. <a href="http://www.agloco.com/r/BBFJ0259">http://www.agloco.com/r/BBFJ0259</a>
