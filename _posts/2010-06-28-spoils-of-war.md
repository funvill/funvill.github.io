<strong>How to Play This Game</strong>
Each player takes turns being the bank.  The players place bets againts the banker for one round.  One player (usually the player to the bank&quot;s left) rolls the 3 dice.  If the total of the dice is higher then 10 the players win and the banker pays out an equal amount to there bets.  If the player rolls a 10 or less, the banker wins and takes the players bets.

The banker is always at a disadvantage and hustlers try and avoid taking up the position.

<strong>Variations</strong>
Bump is a variant played with increasing stakes and increasing odds for the bank.  If all three dice roll the same number, all players must double their bet, the bankers winning number is raised by two (from 10 to 12), and the dice are rolled again.  This continues if all three dice again roll the same number raising the winning number to 10, 12, 14, 16, then 18, at which point the banker has all but won.
