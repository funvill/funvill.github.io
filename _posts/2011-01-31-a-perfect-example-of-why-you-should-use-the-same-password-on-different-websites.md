I know this because they send you a weekly email with updates to the site and puts your password at the bottom of the email so you can easily login.

<a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/01/31/1856202/PlentyofFish-Hacked-Founder-Emails-Hackers-Mom?from=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Slashdot/slashdot+(Slashdot)">Plenty of fish</a> was hacked and their data wasÂ stolenÂ by a 3rd party. They now have your email address and a password to try for other sites.

Do you use the same password for Plenty of fish as yourÂ Facebook? Yes? Well someone can now login to yourÂ FacebookÂ account and pretend to be you. maybe change the password and tell all yourÂ friendsÂ that youÂ actuallyÂ like having sex with farmÂ animalsÂ or your cheating on your wife with so and so.

<strong>Question</strong>:

Well what am I suppose to do, I can'tÂ rememberÂ 1000s different passwords?

<strong>Answer</strong>:

Well you could use a program to generate and store the passwords for you. Something like <a href="http://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>. It works for all phones and computers, anything that can run on java. Â You could hash the domain name of the site and use it to generate a password for you.

Here are some tips for creating new passwords.
