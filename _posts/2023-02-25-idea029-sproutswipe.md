## One Line Pitch

Use cell phone sensors to create a filtered list of suitable plants for a space, then show the plants using Augmented Reality.  Dating app for plants.

## Description

A user points a camera at a location that they would like to put a plant. Maybe next to a window or on a shelf, etc… The cell phone takes a photo of the location and see how much light this area gets, if its close to a window, what direction it is facing, the location in the world, the current temperature. Then asks the user a series of wizard-like questions like how much effort you want to put in. Do you have pets, etc...

Using all this information it creates a filtered list of available plants that would do well in this location. Using this filtered list it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to show you what each plant would look like in this location. Then using a tinder like interface, swipe right for yes, swipe left for no. It allows you to create a short list of plants that you like the look of in that location.

I expect that there are only a few types, locations, and profiles that most people will get. We can give these profiles unique quirky names. Giving people a sense of tribalism as being part of a group, their group.

### Types of Locations

- Sun Spot: A location that gets a lot of direct sunlight.
- Shade Haven: A location that is mostly shaded throughout the day.
- Cozy Corner: A small, intimate space that is perfect for a compact plant.
- Window Wonder: A location that is close to a window and gets indirect sunlight.
- Desk Oasis: A location that is perfect for small, low-maintenance plants that can thrive in an office environment.

### Types of Plants

- Low-Key Loungers: Low-maintenance plants that require minimal care and attention.
- Happy Hour Hosts: Plants that are perfect for entertaining and creating a relaxing atmosphere.
- Fresh Air Friends: Plants that are known for their air-purifying properties and ability to improve indoor air quality.
- Mood Boosters: Plants that are known for their ability to boost mood and reduce stress.
- Desert Dreamers: Plants that can thrive in arid environments and require minimal watering.

Now that they have selected a plant that they want. The app can show them a list of local nurseries or we can partner with a company that ships plants on demand (https://plantsome.ca/), so they can order the plants directly from within the app.

Soil and Water Needs: In addition to light and temperature, plants also have specific soil and water needs. You could consider adding questions to determine the soil type and the user's watering habits.

Plant Size and Growth Rate: Some plants grow tall, while others spread out horizontally. You could ask users how much space they have for the plant and how quickly they want it to grow. Show what the plant would look like after 5 years.

Plant Care Information: Once a user has selected a plant, you could provide them with information on how to care for it. This could include watering schedules, pruning instructions, and information on fertilizers and pesticides. This could be shown on the tinder like profile (Swipe down)

A plant recommendation engine. Really play up the dating app functionality for plants.

## Prior art

- [Plantsome plant finder](https://plantsome.ca/pages/plantfinder) - A wizard like Q/A system to find the plant that works best for you. 
- [Plant Life Balance app](https://mashable.com/article/plant-life-balance-app-ar) - Augmented reality but without the sensors or Q/A system to find out if the plant would actually be happy there. 
- [Inaturalist Seek](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) - Machine learning for plant ID detection. It can be used to find plants that you like the look of and find their house plant equivalent. It has a huge database of stats about each plant and what it likes. There data is open and can be used to feed this app.

## Market

Plant loves, home decorators, interior decorators, people looking to make a more healthy environments, people who want to know “what if”

Particularly useful for people who are new to gardening or those who have limited knowledge of plants and their care requirements.

The market could include homeowners, apartment renters, office managers, and anyone else who has indoor or outdoor space to decorate with plants.

Additionally, the product could be marketed to nurseries and plant delivery services that want to provide their customers with an easy-to-use plant recommendation tool. This could help them differentiate themselves from their competitors and attract new customers who are looking for personalized plant recommendations.
