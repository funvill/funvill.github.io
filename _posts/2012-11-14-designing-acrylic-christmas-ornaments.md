<img class="size-full wp-image-2987 alignright" title="orderments" src="/public/uploads/2012/11/orderments.png" alt="" width="228" height="228" />Today I designed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_ornament">Christmas ornaments</a>Â that I am planning on cutting on <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/">VHS's laser cutter</a>. The white sections will be cut first, followed by the red, leaving only the black left. I plan to put a small thread though the "O" of holiday....

As I write this I just notice now that there is an extra "D" in HOLIDAY... Opps, I will fix that before I cut it.

VHS is also planning on having a Christmas tree in the space with the hope that the members will put home made ornaments on it.
