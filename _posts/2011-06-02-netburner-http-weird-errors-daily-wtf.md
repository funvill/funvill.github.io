<strong>Daily WTF</strong>

<a href="/public/uploads/2011/06/netburner-logo.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1505" title="netburner-logo" src="/public/uploads/2011/06/netburner-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" height="93" /></a>I got these weird errors while attempting to compile a Netburner project with NbEclipse. The project included the HTTP driver as well as some custom generated pages. After bashing my head against the wall for an hour I figure out what caused these errors. Because the HTTP driver has been loaded you are required to have a file in the <em>/http/index.html</em> folder to get NbEclipse to compile.
