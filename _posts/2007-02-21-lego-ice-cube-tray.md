A tray made of silicone that can be used to make Lego shaped ice cubes.
And it only costs 7.99.
I found this nifty little item on <a href="http://freshfodder.wordpress.com/2006/10/18/lego-ice-cube-tray-799/">freshfodder.wordpress.com</a>
You can buy your own <a href="http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=EL502">Lego Ice cub tray</a> from Lego's online store

That would be an interesting project.  I will post pictures if I ever get around to it.
