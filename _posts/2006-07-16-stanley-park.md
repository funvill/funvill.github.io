Stanley Park, Vancouver&quot;s first park, is an evergreen oasis of 400 hectares (1,000 acres) close to the heart of Vancouver&quot;s downtown core. Its natural west coast atmosphere offering a back drop of majestic cedar, hemlock and fir trees embraces visitors and transports them to an environment rich in tranquility.
