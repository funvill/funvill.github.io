<blockquote>The Blink sketch is the most basic sketch for most micro processors (Arduino, Launchpad, etc..).Â Â Its a very simple sketch that just turns on and off an LED. You can do the same thing on the Raspberry Pi with the GPIO pins. Its a good start up tutorial for getting you started with your Raspberry PI, Adafruit WebIDE, and Python

<strong>What we will be doing</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Installing and Updating the OS working on your RPi</li>
	<li>Connecting and using SSH on your Raspberry PI</li>
	<li>Installing theÂ <a href="https://vancouver.hackspace.ca/wp/2013/02/04/raspberry-pi-python-webide-gpio-pins-blink-sketch-tuesday-feb-5th/(http://learn.adafruit.com/webide/overview">WebIDE</a>,</li>
	<li>UsingÂ <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>Â and the GPIO pins to get an LED to blink.</li>
</ol>
