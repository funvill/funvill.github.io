Not being a writer or wanting to be one I am effectively disqualified from the compaction.

So instead I am joining the <a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/archives/2005/11/16/mabegromo/">MabeGroMo</a>.<a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/archives/2005/11/16/mabegromo/">

<h3>MaBeGroMo Rules</h3>
<strong>Rule 1:</strong> At some point between now and November 1, you take a €œbefore€ picture of yourself and put your razor away.
<strong>Rule 2:</strong> At some point after November 30, you take an €œafter€ picture of yourself, and decide whether to reunite with your razor or renew your short-term contract with your newly found friend. You may then claim the title of €œMaBeGroMo Member€
<strong>Rule 3:</strong> If you make it to February 14, you have beaten the extended challenge and can rightfully claim the title of €œMaBeGroMo Champion.€
<strong>Rule 4:</strong> If you make it past February 14, step out of the Home Depot, put down the deer carcass, and shower well before signing up for several internet €œdating€ services. This is just a suggestion.

You€™re thinking about it. I can see it. I€™ve taken the liberty of answering some of your presented concerns to give you the encouragement to get started in <a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/beards/the-beard-faq/">The Beard FAQ</a>.  Good luck.
