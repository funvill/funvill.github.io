<a href="/public/uploads/2007/11/beard.jpg"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/11/beard.thumbnail.jpg" align="right" /></a>One of my good friends are starting the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> today so far hes gotten <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/smooth/">457 words in</a>.  Not being a writer or wanting to be one I am effectively disqualified from the compaction.

So instead I am joining the <a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/archives/2005/11/16/mabegromo/">MabeGroMo</a>.<a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/archives/2005/11/16/mabegromo/">

<h3>MaBeGroMo Rules</h3>
<strong>Rule 1:</strong> At some point between now and November 1, you take a "
before" picture of yourself and put your razor away.
<strong>Rule 2:</strong> At some point after November 30, you take an "
after" picture of yourself, and decide whether to reunite with your razor or renew your short-term contract with your newly found friend. You may then claim the title of "
MaBeGroMo Member"
<strong>Rule 3:</strong> If you make it to February 14, you have beaten the extended challenge and can rightfully claim the title of "
MaBeGroMo Champion."
<strong>Rule 4:</strong> If you make it past February 14, step out of the Home Depot, put down the deer carcass, and shower well before signing up for several internet "
dating" services. This is just a suggestion.

You&quot;re thinking about it. I can see it. I&quot;ve taken the liberty of answering some of your presented concerns to give you the encouragement to get started in <a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/beards/the-beard-faq/">The Beard FAQ</a>.  Good luck.
