<div>I bought a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> board for a green house project I was planning to do sometime last year. To regulate the temperature, turn on and off lights and fans, data logging, ect. A friend ended up giving me some deadacated hardware making the Arduino project a lot of extra work for very little gain and I abandon it. This little board has been sitting on my shelf for the good part of a year collecting dust.</div>
A few days ago I saw some videos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo">sumobots</a> (<strong><em>Robot-sumo</em></strong><em>, or pepe-sumo, is a </em><em>sport</em><em> in which two </em><em>robots</em><em> attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of </em><em>sumo</em><em>). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.</em>) on <a href="http://robots.net/article/2763.html">robots.net</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sumobots&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">youtube</a>.

Instantly fell in love with the idea and started looking for a local robot club that did compations. <a href="http://vancouverroboticsclub.org/">http://vancouverroboticsclub.org/</a> came up first in google. They do run regulate contests such as <a href="http://vancouverroboticsclub.org/contests/basic-table-top/">Basic Table Top Challenge</a> that look interesting. I was looking for something more competitive but its as good as any place to start.

I ended up buying a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/">motor shield</a> from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">http://www.adafruit.com/</a> that worked perfectly with my RC car that I bought a few years ago. After a few hours of tweaking I was able to write a simple API to control it properly. The RC car only really has two speeds, really really fast and reverse. So it speeds thou the course I programed a little too fast.

Next is to add sensor to it so it drive its self with out predefining the path. I ordered some medium and short range ultrasonic range finder and a few other toys to play with.

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_wart"><em>Wall wart</em></a><em> is a slang term for certain types of power supply - typically those that are embedded in an over-sized AC plug.</em></li>
