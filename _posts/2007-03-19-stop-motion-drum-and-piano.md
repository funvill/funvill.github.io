A video where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=lassegg">lassegg</a> hits each note on a drum and piano separately and edited them together to make a song. Its pretty good if you ask me.

Some "Youtube" people are saying that he ripped off Michel Gondry's video but there is a pretty important difference between the two. Michel Gondry's is mixing drum sequences while lassegg is mixing just the beats of the song them remixing them.

I think there is a substantial difference between the two.
Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaB_Do8HV2c">Michel Gondry's video</a> and heres <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzqumbhfxRo">lassegg video</a>
What one do you like better?

And here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYulV4c28nA">a really slow one with a Guitar</a> thats not too good but still uses the same tech.
