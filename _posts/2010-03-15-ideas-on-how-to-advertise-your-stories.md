Here are a few different ways that you can advertise your story before and after it has been published. 

Blog, You should start a blog as soon as possible. You don't have to update it every day, just when ever you get accepted at a new magazine and when the story is published. A blog can help you keep your fans up to date on where you are getting published.

Get friends with blogs to post about your story. Try to get as many of your friends to update there blogs with post about your story. You can reciprocate when they get published. 

Social media sites such as StumbleUpon, Digg, Redit, ect. Don't underestimate these websites they can bring thousands of visitors to your story. 


Facebook, Create a link, update your status. Create a group for your writing. 
Make a post in forums and community
