I build the <a href="/giant-spin-art-maker-faire-2011-vancouver/">first version</a> of my giant spin art back in may after reading build instructions in <a href="http://makeprojects.com/">Make magazine</a> Volume 25.

It work okay but had a few problems. It was direct drive driven and I was worried about burning out the motor. It was scary fast and got unstable as it speeds up.

Three days before Maker Faire I decide to rebuild it. First thing I did was make a new box out of lumber one that I could mount the motor underneath. Then used two pully and a belt to reduce the speed of the motor. I mounted a sheet of thick foam board on top of the center pully. It was much lighter then the wooden board I was using before making it much more stable and safer. I used some plastic fencing, duck tape and paper as a splash guard so people wouldn't get covered in paint as it spins. The plastic fence worked but looked ugly.

<strong>Things to change for next year.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>More paper</strong> - I purchased 100 sheets of poster board that I cut in half (good quality). As well as a book of painting craft paper with 160 sheets (No as good). For a total of 360 sheets of paper. I was completely out of paper, and things that I could use as paper by noon of the 2nd day. This was good thing as well because it gave me a chance to wonder around the Faire and see what everyone else was making.</li>
	<li><strong>Safety Fence</strong> - Three kids fell in to the spin art box! No one was hurt but they did get covered with paint. The plastic splash fence that I used as a splash guard couldn't hold the weight of a child as they reached in to the center to  pore paint on to the board.</li>
	<li><strong>Ugly Splash fence</strong> - The thing looked ugly from the outside. It could have easily been fixed up by putting spin art paints all round the outside of the splash fence.</li>
	<li><strong>An assistant</strong> - Very important, It was almost impossible to go to the bathroom with a line of children waitting patiently for their turn. I also was trying to get a photo of every child with their spin art but it was impossible while operating the box at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>A time laps from above</strong> - It would have been really interesting to watch the entire thing from a camera mounted above the box doing a time laps with a picture once every 5 secs.</li>
</ul>
