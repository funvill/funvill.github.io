The other day I was looking at a USB cell charger from ThinkGeek.
A battery that charges while it is connected to my USB port.
But I found most took to long to charge or they where expensive.

I found project started by Stefan Vorkoetter that shows up to create a fast charger for NiMH/NiCd Cells <a href="http://www.stefanv.com/electronics/usb_charger.html">USB Powered Charger for Two AA NiMH/NiCd Cells</a>

The project looks pretty simple and I plan on trying it out this weekend.
