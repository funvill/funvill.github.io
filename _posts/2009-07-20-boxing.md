Boxing is a Dice Drinking game

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 dice</li>
	<li>2 or more players</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Split up in to two teams.
Each team rolls one dice the team with the lowest roll has to drink, if you both get the same roll then you re roll.
If the loser doesn€™t take the shot of beer within ten seconds it is a TKO.
If they fall over, drool, pee, or puke its a knockout.  This is usually what happens.

The last man standing wins!!!
