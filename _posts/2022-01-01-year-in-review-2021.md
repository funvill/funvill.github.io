It's been another unusual year with the continued [global COVID pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19), less eventful than 2020 but overall good. I found a new hobby that makes me happy, completed a health plan, and moved to a new city.

## Birding

At the start of the year, Lori got a telephoto camera lens for herself on her birthday. A [Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/c015_150_600_5_63/). I started to borrow the lens to go birding and quickly became one of my favorite hobbies. It really speaks to my trend of “gotta catch them all” style projects, similar to my [2020 Vancouver parks project](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2020-vancouver-parks/). It’s like a giant hunt and seek puzzle!

Before this year I knew there were more than ~20 types of birds in Vancouver but I couldn’t name many of them. I often confused the difference between a Sparrow, Chickadee, Junco, Finch, Towhee, Swallow, or Starling to Lori horror. Everything that was small was a sparrow, anything that was black was a crow, if it swam it was a duck, and everything else was either a pigeon or a gull.

A year later I can correctly identify +100 species of local birds, often by their calls alone. I know the migration activity of most of the common species, and what they eat, where they make their nests, and where is the best place to find them.

I started carrying around peanuts wherever I went, to feed the crows. Training them to do tricks for the peanuts. I could tell the difference between some of my favorite crows based on their behavior.

I quickly started amassing a number of good photos of birds and was looking for a new project to do for the year after the parks project from last year. I decided to make a deck of playing cards using the photos of the birds. “Birds of play”. You can read more about this project here [2021-bird-playing-cards](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2021-bird-playing-cards/)

By the end of the year, I had taken 31,893 photos, [2,125 observations, 363 different species](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/2021-vancouver-steven-and-lori-)

I have been posting some of the best bird photos on my Instagram ([@funvill](https://www.instagram.com/funvill/)) and on [iNaturalist.org/people/funvill](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/funvill)

Some of my favorites are;

Birding has changed my life for the better.

## Housing

In 2020 the company that I work for, [Chipkin](https://store.chipkin.com) closed down its offices and I started to work from home (WFH) permanently. This meant that all the equipment that I use for work ended up in my living room and slowly took over my entire apartment. Without a spare room or office to differentiate my work life from my home life they merged into an endless workday. I got a lot of work done but my stress skyrocketed.

I started looking for a new place to live where I could have an office and more space. The market was crazy with houses going for 20-30% over asking with no subjects. After looking at over 50 places in 4 months, making multiple offers, and being outbid over and over again, I expanded my search area outside of Vancouver to Burnaby.

In the middle of May, I got an accepted offer on a townhouse near [the "Amazing" Brentwood](https://theamazingbrentwood.com/) in Burnaby. This meant moving out of Vancouver where I have spent the last 20 years of my life. It was a hard choice to leave Vancouver but it was a good opportunity in a great location and hit all my major requirements. A door in an office that I can close at the end of the day. Close to shops and restaurants, parks, access to transit, outdoor space, and just more space to breathe.

1250 sqft, 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 floors, fireplace, washer and dryer, Gym, Sauna/hot tub, 2 mins to the grocery stores, 10 mins walk to ~30 restaurants, movie theater, hardware stores, drug stores, etc… Best of all, I converted one of the bedrooms into an office, with a door that closes at the end of the work day.

I have been living here for six months and so far so good.

## Trips/Vacation

We didn’t travel much this year because; house hunting, packing, moving, and setting up the new place took up most of the year. We did a lot of hikes in search of birds.

We took our annual [Canada Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Day) trip to our friend's cabin in [Shuswap Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuswap_Lake). I have been there many times before but this time I took the opportunity to look for spiders to photograph. Now that I was looking for them there everywhere!

I made a trip to see some old friends on the Sunshine Coast. Found a few new-to-me bird species while I was there.

In December we went to Palm Springs to escape the cold. We spotted a [Greater Roadrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_roadrunner) in the wild (They do exist! Beep Beep). Got to see my first oasis and a [Turkey Vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_vulture).

<table><tr><td><img src='/public/uploads/2022/year-in-review-PalmSprings-1.png' alt='PalmSprings sign'></td><td><img src='/public/uploads/2022/year-in-review-PalmSprings-2.png' alt='Greater Roadrunner'></td></tr><tr><td><img src='/public/uploads/2022/year-in-review-PalmSprings-3.png' alt='oasis'></td><td><img src='/public/uploads/2022/year-in-review-PalmSprings-4.png' alt='rocks'></td></tr></table>

While in [Palm Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs,_California) we took a trip to [Joshua Tree National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree_National_Park). The [Joshua Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia) look like the trees from [Dr. Seuss - The Lorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax)

## What's next for 2022?

We have booked our dry suit [scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving) lessons so we are able to dive in Vancouver’s cold water. I really enjoyed the scuba diving we did on our 2018 Asia trip. I have a few friends that are experienced divers that have been trying to get me into this hobby for years.

If it becomes safe to travel internationally again, I would like to see Morocco; [Casablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca), [Marrakesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh), [Fez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez,_Morocco), [Chefchaouen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chefchaouen) maybe even take a quick detour up into [Madrid Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid). I miss exploring the world.

The new townhouse has a lot of strange angles that need custom furniture. I would like to get back into some wood working to build custom furniture. Building things with my hands.

Looking forward to new adventures in 2022.
