<a href="http://www.camilladerrico.com/">Camilla d'Errico</a> is one of my favorite Vancouver artists, I first met her at the main street monthly comic convention back in early 2006. Her work was amazing her helmet head paintings blew me away. She had a very original style, with a hint of Anime,  a bit of sex appeal, colorful, and with the obvious experience that makes her work stand out of the crowed.

In 2007 she started to pop up a lot more as she started doing a lot more show local and abode.  A list of <a href="http://www.camilladerrico.com/upcomingevents.html">her upcoming shows</a> can be found on her website.

She also sells prints of her work on her website, I bought a few when i met her at the comic con.

Camillia has a standing show of her work at the <a href="http://www.aydengallery.com/">ayden gallery</a> in Tinseltown Vancouver. I highly suggest that you check out her work.

A online gallery of her work can be found on her website <a href="http://www.camilladerrico.com/">Camilladerrico.com</a>, She also has a <a href="http://www.camilladerrico.com/"></a><a href="http://www.myspace.com/camilladerrico">MySpace</a>
