But when I got home and plugged them in to my phone it sounded dull, like it was missing all the treble. I connected them to my computer thinking it might be some setting or something with my phone, same thing.  Out of chance I pressed and held down the mic button and it sound great, clear crisp sound. It looks like I would have to hold down the mic button to get anything out of these earphones.

First thing i thought was that it was a manufactures mistake, it happens from time to time. I searched skullcandy.com website and found other people with the <a href="http://ca.skullcandy.com/forum/over-ear-headphones/2813-mic-in-the-hesh-electric-animal.html">same problem</a>. So I decided to call up the support line and see if it was just user error. After 45 mins on hold with one of the worst <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_branch_exchange#Private_branch_exchange">PBX systems</a> I have encountered I got thou to a support staff.

Apparently this series of head phones are only compatible with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4">IPhone 4</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and is not compatible with my phone or my PC or my amp or any of the other music playing devices in my house. Take a min to let that sink in, A length of wire connected to a speaker with plastic wrapped around it has compatibly issues. Thats like saying <strong>this pencil is not compatible with yellow paper</strong>.  I made him repeat it a few times to make sure I was understanding him correctly.

<strong><em>"The Hesh skull candy head phones are only compatible with IPhone 4 and Xbox 360"</em></strong>

I was shocked, I could rant about the benefit of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osr">open source standards</a> over proprietary connections, or how proprietary standards encourage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly">monopolies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices">Anti-competitive practices</a> but you all heard this before and i'm getting tired of saying it over and over again.

So I asked for a refund. Nope, but they would give me store credit, if I paid for the shipping cost to send it back to them so I can buy another proprietary non-compatible set of head phones. I think I would rather wrap the head phones in a brick and send it thou the front window of <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1441+west+UTE+BlV+Park+city,+utal,+84098&amp;sll=49.891235,-97.15369&amp;sspn=46.914964,114.169922&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=1441+Ute+Blvd,+Park+City,+Summit,+Utah+84098,+United+States&amp;ll=40.724502,-111.539163&amp;spn=0.001681,0.003484&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.724404,-111.539064&amp;panoid=ymWL2l9mOil8q7-pLypBjg&amp;cbp=12,223.15,,0,7.98">their head offices</a>.
