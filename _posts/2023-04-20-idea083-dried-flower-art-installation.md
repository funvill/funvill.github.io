A staircase tunnel of glowing dried flowers

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\rebecca-louise-law.png' alt='rebecca-louise-law' title='rebecca-louise-law' style="float: right; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px">I have a staircase that goes up to the 2nd floor of my townhouse. It's dark with no windows and bad light. Framed photos look terrible but I have found that plastic plants and silk flowers work well. I don’t want to use plastic plants as they look terrible close up and silk flowers are too expensive to buy or make.

I like having fresh flowers in my house, they are a cheap way of cheering up my place, and there are several florists around me.

Instead of artificial flowers, I was thinking of drying some of the flowers that I am already buying. After I have a few hundred flowers, I can compose them and sandwich them between acrylic plates. The acrylic plates can be placed as an arch over the staircase with a slot lighting behind it. It should look like a tube of glowing flowers.

The acrylic plates can be cut to form different shapes like diamonds or spades. Each one would have a small LED embedded in it so that it would glow. The power cables can be what suspends it from the ceiling.
