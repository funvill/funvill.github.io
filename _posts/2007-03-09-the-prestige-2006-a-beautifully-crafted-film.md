Its a story about two competing magicians locked in a bitter rivalry that ends with deadly consequences. The story takes place in the picturesque back drop of turn of the century Victorian London with <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0413168/">Hugh Jackman</a> as Robert Angier and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a> as Alfred Borden  fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, a plot riddled with jealous, obsession, deceit, revenge that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The stunning setting, fantastic acting, a clever screen play with a twist that I didn't suspect until the last 5 min of the movie, an ending that ties up all the lose ends, the mystery of how they did there tricks, The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige... all reason why I loved this moive. Its even got <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000309/">David Bowie</a> as Nikola Tesla.

10/10 one of the best movies of the year.
