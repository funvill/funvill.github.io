Black or Red is a Drinking game played with Cards

<strong>What you will need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 or more people (the more players the better)</li>
	<li>A deck of cards</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Everyone will sit at a table and you will start the game clockwise.  First person picks either black or red.  If they choose the right color they pick who ever they want to drink; if they get it wrong they have to drink.

If player gets the color right three times in a row they can make up a rule; (For example: you can&quot;t point, or you can&quot;t say drink).  Player continues until they get the color wrong and it goes to the next person and so on.  Same rules apply to everyone.
