Disarm The Bomb is a drinking game.

<strong>What you will need</strong>
<ul>
	<li>4 cans of beer</li>
	<li>tape (duck tap works the best)</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
First, you need to tape together four beer cans in a cube shape, each one pointing in a different direction.  Next, you take the person whose job it is to diffuse the bomb and tape his or her hands (both of them) to the bomb of four beers, and give them ten minutes to diffuse the bomb.  Once the person&quot;s lips touch the beer,  they cannot come off except to puke or choke.  If the person cannot diffuse the bomb, (either by not drinking fast enough or puking or whatnot), all those watching must dump the remaining beer on the persons head.

Because his hands are taped to the beer, he will have to use his mouth or something more inventive to open the beers.
No spilling!!
