## One Line Pitch

Create a mobile of regular polyhedrons and other geometry shapes using paper craft

## Description

I have always been [fascinated](https://www.instagram.com/p/2SmS2hA5YK/?taken-by=funvill) by regular [polyhedrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron) and paper craft. I would like to make a mobile that I can hang from the ceiling with several regular polyhedrons made from paper crafting.

There are dozens of examples of this already. The [paper craft plans](https://www.polyhedra.net/en/) for each polyhedron are readily available online. It should just take time and lots of patients.
