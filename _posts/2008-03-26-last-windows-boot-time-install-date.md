Do you remember the exact date or time when you last switched on the computer ?
Here&quot;s a simple DOS command to help you out:
<blockquote>systeminfo | find /i "
boot time"</blockquote>
This will show the time when you last rebooted the computer.
If you want to know when you stalled windows on your PC
<blockquote>systeminfo | find /i "
install date"</blockquote>
