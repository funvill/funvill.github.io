## One Line Pitch

A lamp made of acrylic shards of pressed flowers in the shape of a lotus flower

## Description

Continuing from the [Idea 083 - Dried flower art installation](https://blog.abluestar.com/idea083-dried-flower-art-installation/).

Each shard will have LEDs embedded into the base. The LEDs will illuminate the dried flower petals as well as edge lite the acrylic shard. Similar to my [Edge-Lit-Lantern](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmu26HDF9Uf/?taken-by=funvill) project.

The base will have angled slots for each shard to be mounted in. The shape should resemble a lotus flower of shards. The base will hide all the electronics for running the LEDs, as well as a light bulb to add to the illumination. It should be built using parametric design so it can be scaled up as needed.

The whole thing should look like a Lotus flower of glowing petales with little flowers in each flower petal.
