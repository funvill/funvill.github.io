<strong>Tool at GM Place Review </strong>
The stage was set up with a 2-3 meter high white wall that made the musicians look huge compared to the backdrop, they had a few projectors creating some pretty trippy visuals on the wall, it more and more intense with each passing song. Adam Jones was off to the front left and Justin Chancellor on to the right, both where barley in the light of the stage for most of the show. Maynard dead center of the stage, right of him was Danny Carey with a huge drum kit. Above the stage were 3 circle light stages that dropped down to maybe 15 feet above the stage and rotated around, red green and blues. A complex show of red and green lasers that bounced off precisely placed mirrors around GM place filling the place with an amazing ligh show, worthy of praise.

The track list when something like this;
<ul>
	<li>Stinkfist</li>
	<li>The Pot</li>
	<li>46 &amp; 2</li>
	<li>Jambi</li>
	<li>Schism</li>
	<li>Rosetta Stoned</li>
	<li>Right in Two</li>
	<li>Sober</li>
	<li>Lateralus</li>
	<li>Vicarious</li>
	<li>Aenima</li>
</ul>
Right after Lateralus a huge track epic with the crowd, they came out and sat down to the edge of the stage feeding off the praise and energy of the crowd, Danny Carey in his Lakers jersey just pumping the crowd for energy.

Amazing show, I will be first in line next time they come anywhere close to Vancouver.
