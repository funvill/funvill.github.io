I laser cut this object sesigned by <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/sculpture/frabjous.html">George W. Hart</a> as a gift for my mother for xmas this year.I got the original design from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12271">Thingiverse</a>, made for 4mm ply wood. I modify the files to work with the 6mm birch wood that I had available at the space.
