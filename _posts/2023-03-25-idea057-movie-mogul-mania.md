## One Line Pitch

A fantasy movie league where players draft actors and films to earn points based on award nominations and wins, box office sales, and other movie statistics.

## Description

A website that allows you to build your dream team/cast for a movie. You select actors, directors, production companies, visual effects departments, even full movies, etc…

Then throughout the year you gain points when movies are released, award nominations and wins, box office sales, theater count, and other movie statistics that are pulled from [BoxOfficeMojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)

Basically betting between your friends on the predicted outcomes of movies before they are released.

An early pick bonus for players who make their selections earlier. The ability to switch your cast until the day before timed events (release dates, award ceremonies, etc…), but with diminishing points.

Possible names for this website: Hollywood Heroes League, Film Fanatics Fantasy, Movie Mogul Mania, Box Office Battle Royale, Cinema Champ Challenge, Flicks Fantasy League, Award Season Showdown, Movie Madness Mayhem, Silver Screen Scoring, Film Frenzy Fantasy

### Interface

For each roll you have a Primary and Secondary. You select an actor or director or production company that has a movie coming out in the next 1 year to fill your spots. The earlier you guess the more points you get. Then when the timed event (movie release, award ceremony) happens the points are awarded and the spot is freed up.

The user can switch their primary and secondary at any time but picks closer to the timed event don’t reward as much as long timer betting.

### Unsorted

- After someone selects their dream team there is not much of a reason for them to come back to the website throughout the year. We need some artificial maintenance tasks to keep them engaged. 
- For each movie, actor, etc… there should be a news selection like what would be on a stocks page. This will help users make informed decisions on who should be on their team.
- Instead of Fantasy sports leagues this system could be based around the stock market, where you buy shares in movies or actors. Dividends are paid out based on the timed events, shares can be traded between people as needed.

## Prior art

Fantasy sports leagues, movie prediction websites, and movie review websites such as Rotten Tomatoes.

- [Hollywood stock exchange](https://www.hsx.com/) - Buy shares of your favorite actors and their new movies. Watch their values rise or fall based on their success in The Entertainment MarketTM. Prices soar with a blockbuster opening at the box office and plummet with a bomb no one went to see.

## Market

Movie enthusiasts, fantasy sports players, and anyone interested in predicting movie success.
