Its been a busy month, the start of the year always is.
<ul>
	<li>Built my first <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> APP with <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">Phone gap</a>. Its aÂ happinessÂ surveyÂ that lets users report there currentÂ happinessÂ level once an hour. The reports go back to my website and get stored in a database. I hope to run this survey for a year and see if i can see any patterns in peoplesÂ happiness. The app prompts them once an hour (during the day) for input soÂ hopefullyÂ they will report in good times as well as bad times. The first version had 5 different buttons but i found that people only the middle option. I have since switched it to using an analog progress bar and has produced must moreÂ variedÂ results. Currently I have 32 people running this survey and I plan to add more as I refine the app. This app is notÂ availableÂ to the public.</li>
	<li>EveryDayFiction IPhone/IPad app. Again I am using Phone gap with <a href=" http://jquerymobile.com/">JQuery mobile</a> forÂ theming. its not going as well as the happiness survey. This app when it is done will beÂ availableÂ to the public thouÂ iTunesÂ or android market.</li>
	<li>I been making/downloading and building a stencils collection to decorate VHS. Simple one layer images.  <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/stencils_2011-01-31_171803.zip">Archive of collection

	<li>Me andÂ <a href="http://www.jordanlapp.com/">Jordan</a> submitted a short video to theÂ <a href="http://www.thepeak.fm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=31&amp;postid=189">The peak CommercialÂ contest</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_A-pdwWRdg">Our entry</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/PEAKCommercials">everyone Â else'sÂ entries</a>
To create this video, we downloaded several days worth of the Peak's 12 hour playlist, then wrote a program that downloaded the lyrics to each song from the web (we're only fabulous commercial producers at night. During the day, we're software engineers).Â Next, we wrote out the phrases that we wanted in the commercial and used a special program to find each word in the list of lyrics. Some words weren't available (apparently no one sings about "bacon". Go figure.) so we rewrote our "script" several times to suit what we had available.Â That gave us a list of songs where a particular word was used. From that, we chose songs where the word we wanted was enunciated clearly by the singer (which was super hard, cause rock stars mumble).Â Finally we added subtitles to help the viewer understand the word, spent countless hours editing the heck out of it so that it was 30 seconds long and our entry was complete.Â Since this commercial is a transformative work, rights are covered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing">Fair Dealing</a> (the Canadian equivalent of Fair Use)

	<li>The script I used to <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/thebadguy_2011-01-31_173324.zip">scrape the lyrics pages for certain songs</a>. The script its self only took about 30mins from start to finish to write. No wonder there are so many spammers out there that scrape other peoples websites for content and publish it as their own... I wouldn't have even bothered if i knew about this project. <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a> that seems to have done the same thing I have but better and more organized then I could have with my limited time.</li>
	<li>Moving people in the rain sucks...</li>
	<li>Most of my time has been occupied with the launch of <a href="http://raygunrevival.com/">http://raygunrevival.com</a> all the steps that you need to go thou to launch a website areÂ exhausting. I think it turned out okay.

	<li>Me, <a href="http://www.jordanlapp.com/blog">Jordan Lapp</a>, and<a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/"> Andrew LeBlanc</a> filmed a short trailer forÂ <a href="http://raygunrevival.com/">RayGunRevival</a> to launch the website. The trailer has taken longer to edit then I would have thought and has missed the launch of the site. ButÂ hopefullyÂ we can still use it as aÂ advertisingÂ medium. I will post it as soon as its ready.</li>
	<li>I have stoppedÂ developmentÂ on <a href="http://www.camilladerrico.com/">http://www.camilladerrico.com/</a> my other paying projects and pet projects where taking up too much of my time. I could not keep up with updates thatÂ Camilla needed and was falling farther and farther behind. IÂ regretÂ that I can't make time for her but my other projects are moreÂ importantÂ to me at this time. Good luck!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.everydaypoets.com/">Everydaypoets</a> book was launched this month by the fabulousÂ <a href="http://copyeditproof.com/">Camille Campbell</a>.

	<li>Started <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/movies/">rating movies again</a>.Â LetsÂ see if I can keep up with it this time. This wordpress plugin isn't the best and if i ever find some time i will rewrite it with someÂ socialÂ elements. (FacebookÂ updates,Â communityÂ taging, ect)</li>
