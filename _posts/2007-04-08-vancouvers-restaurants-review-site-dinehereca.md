<img src="/public/uploads/2007/04/restaurant_icon.gif" alt="restaurant_icon" align="right" />Vancouver has <a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/allrestbyarea.asp">thousands of restaurant</a> to choose from and each week me and a few friends try out a new one. Finding a new restaurants never hard with fantastic websites such as <a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/">Dinehere.ca</a> but its are missing a few nice to have features such as a map of all the restaurants in your area, and select a random restaurant.

Selecting a <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/random_restaurant/">random Vancouver restaurant</a> isn't that hard just select a random number between 1 and 9999 and replace Restaurant ID www.dinehere.ca/restaurant.asp?r={restaurant id} in the address bar. I created a small utility that does this for you and also <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/random_restaurant/">selects a random restaurant type</a>

With out access to Dinehere.ca's database it would be hard to generate a Google map of the local address. (With read DB access I could generate a script with in a day) I have requested the feature a few times but I have not gotten a response. Maybe if a few of my readers also request it they might implement it. <a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/about.asp"> </a><a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/"></a><a href="http://www.dinehere.ca/about.asp">Contact Dinehere.ca</a>

Anyone know of a local Vancouver restaurant site that has a map of the local restaurants?
