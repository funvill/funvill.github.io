## Audio

- [Hacking the Pocket Operator](http://hackingthepo.weebly.com/) - A pocket operator is a cheap, small mini synth, made by *Teenage.engineering* (no link love). But the devices are fragile and easily broken. I only had mine for 30 mins before it [shattered](https://www.reddit.com/r/pocketoperators/comments/f5jd9j/screen_broken_with_30_mins_of_purchase/).  This link is to someone else that had the same issue and was able to figure out the pinout for the LED screen. I would not suggest buying these boards. Do not buy.

## Laser cutter / CNC

- [Squid Hunter model](https://twitter.com/Workshopshed/status/1218511220787097600) - Wooden spinning submarine chasing a squid. Its a kit from [Solarbotics](https://solarbotics.com/), [The Solarbotics Squid Hunting CarouSol Kit](https://solarbotics.com/product/60425) 
- [Ariba Box](https://aribabox.com/) - A list of simple CNC plans for cheap. They have a youtube series as well that goes thought the [design process and assembly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCirX-5FVCqp9dV1mJpU8UzA).

- [Maze dice sculpture](https://www.reddit.com/r/lasercutting/comments/eo6pkp/snub_cube_maze_on_basswood_ply/) - A very cool project where they made plates with a maze design that were glued onto a 20 side dice like sculputre. Here is a picture of the [Connectors](https://i.imgur.com/ccPR7o6.jpg)

## Photography

- [TOP 100 PHOTO IDEAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iByu4oRByh0) - Simple ideas for making interesting photos using props. It gave me some ideas.

## Quantified self and self improvement

- I really liked the advice from CCPGray in this video about about having a [year theme instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) of setting a new years resolution. They have a journaling book that helps supplement the themes idea that can be found here at [cortext brand store](https://cottonbureau.com/products/the-theme-system-journal#/1695095/grey-paper-5x8) not that the book is required.

## Keyboards

- [Hub16](https://www.tindie.com/products/joshajohnson/hub16-programmable-macro-keyboard/) - A Programmable Macro Keyboard tha tI am planning on using to replace my numpad of my keyboard. The knobs are a nice bonus feature. Fully [open source](https://github.com/joshajohnson/hub16) with some good assembly instructions.
