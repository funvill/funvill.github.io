In this workshop attendees will learn how to design and make a unique illuminated digital stained glass window. The illuminated digital stained glass window is animated using fully programmable RGB LEDs and a microprocessor. The effect is a dazzling display of lights. This workshop consists of designing the layout and segments on a sheet of paper. Then attendees scan and converting the image into a vector using inkscape (Free Windows/MAC/Linux application). The vector file is then used to cut out of foam on a desktop CNC router. At the end of this course attendees will get to take home their custom designed 9”x9”x4” stained glass window.

- No experience required.
- Optional laptop is recommended.
- All ages are welcome.
- Ages 13 or younger should be accompanied by an adult.
