## One Line Pitch

Instead of using Blurb publishing tools create the book using HTML and CSS

## Description

<img src="/public/uploads/2023/photobook.png" alt="photobook" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px"/>Every year I make a photo book using [Blurb’s](https://www.blurb.ca/) publishing tool [BookWright](https://www.blurb.ca/bookwright). It's a good beginner tool that allows for drag and drop templates, aligning photos, adding borders and backgrounds, etc…

It has a few problems, such as a cost for producing a PDF proof, no ability to update the entire document styles such as border size of color, text styles, image styles, etc…

I have looked into other publishing tools such as [Affinity publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/). More powerful and full featured then BookWright. For $70 you get a real license, none of that subscription BS. I want to support companies that do this more, happy to pay for software with real licenses. But I found that the learning curve on this tool was too great for me.

Recently Blurb added the feature to [create books from PDFs](https://www.blurb.ca/pdf-to-book#createpdf).

I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS. I can use these tools to create print layouts for a photo book. Then use a headless browser to convert the HTML and CSS into a PDF that can be printed by Blurb. This allows me to create a webpage that also mimics the photo book and I get a PDF version for free.
