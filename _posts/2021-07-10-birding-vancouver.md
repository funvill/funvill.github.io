Since the start of 2021 I have gotten really into birding. I am very new to this hobbie less then a year.

I created the ["birds of play"](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2021-bird-playing-cards/) deck of cards using the photos I took.

When I was starting out I found these resources to be very useful.

- [Introduction to Bird Watching - NV Presentation by Tom Plath, May 6 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc_QZ7I03Kg) - This video goes though the when and where to go birding in Vancouver.
- [Vancouver area birding sites](https://naturevancouver.ca/birding/birding_birding_sites/) - A series of resources. Locations, checklists, when an where, etc...
