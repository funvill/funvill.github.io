Part of my 2023 year in review

## Movies

In February of [2023 Netflix decided to block or upcharge for password sharing of accounts](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-password-sharing-1.6741484). I have been a user of Netflix since the mailed DVD days but with this business choice they made [piracy a better, more user friendly option](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/digital-content-piracy-is-on-the-rise-report-says/). I canceled my account and switched to torrents and a local [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) server.

With [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC50I3ZwlkV08muhc-mK5sJQ) increasing the amount of ads to once every ~10 mins, and pushing their paid service, and Ad blocking. I just haven't been watching many Youtube videos either.

These two changes have significantly contributed to a reduced amount of TV I watch, and it also made it harder to track what I have seen over this year.

According to my TV I had ~237 hours of screen time 2023 or about a 30% drop over all. 21 movies, 29 tv series

I have started to update [My Letter BoxD](https://letterboxd.com/funvill/films/by/entry-rating/size/large/) profile with the revies of all my movies.

**Ranking:**

1. (Great) - I would recommend
2. (Okay) - Its okay it has issues
3. (Meh) - Forgettable, or just plain bad
4. (Bad) - Horrible do not watch
