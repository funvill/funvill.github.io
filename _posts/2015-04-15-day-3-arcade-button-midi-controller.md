Made with the VHS laser cutter. I will be using a [Arduino Leonardo](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLeonardo) to make these buttons into a [midi controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI). This midi controller will be used with [Open Sound Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) to control the LEDS and lighting effects on the outside of my dome project (Pocket Universe). I am waiting on my order of [micro switches from aliexpress](https://talk.hackspace.ca/t/im-buying-microswitches-for-arcade-buttons-do-you-want-any/1799?u=funvill)
