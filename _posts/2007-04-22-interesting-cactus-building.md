<strong>The urban cactus building</strong>
Found via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/30/cactus_building.html">boingboing.net,</a> Who found it on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/30/cactus_building.html"></a><a href="http://archidose.blogspot.com/2006/10/half-dose-30-urban-cactus.html">archidose.blogspot.com</a>

Urban Cactus is a housing project in the Vuurplaat section of Rotterdam by <a href="http://www.ucxarchitects.com/">UCX Architects</a> / Ben Huygen and Jasper Jaegers and done for Vestia Rotterdam Feijenoord/<a href="http://www.estrade.nl/">Estrade Projecten</a>.

Due to its siting at the end of harbor, the architects chose to conceptualize the project as belonging to the "green nerve" rather than the surrounding urban structure.

They placed the 98 residential units on 19 floors, using the pattern of outdoor spaces to determine the overall appearance of the project.

The slightly irregular pattern alternates these outdoor spaces to create what are in effect double-height spaces. Each unit then receives more sunlight than a typical stacked composition.

Also the terrace area might be equivalent to a constant depth extended around the perimeter (say two meters), but their configuration creates larger "rooms" for gardening and for enjoying the outdoors and the city views.
