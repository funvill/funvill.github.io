A 90-minute run that starts in twilight in a suburban neighborhood, then stimulates your senses with a trail run in the mist and inky blackness of the Capilano Canyon. A guided Group run at a gentle pace for the socially-inclined and first time night runner. A Competitive category for those more motivated by the clock and the opportunity to rip their buddy's lungs out. A potluck party and celebration of summer. Entry limited to first 50, so please register early!
