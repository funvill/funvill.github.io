I been with a bunch of different hosts over the past few years
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">Hostgator</a> (Good)- Reseller account, only positive things to say about them so far. Good phone/Chat/Email support. Great response time for there servers. ect...</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> (OKish) - 1800+ domains on shard hosting?! decent email support, lots of features, funny newsletter, downtime every month, and ping time is getting slower each and every month.</li>
	<li><a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media temple</a> (Never again)- Complete and utter garbage, slow, lots of down time. Only used there servers for 2 months before moving.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.hasweb.com/">Hasweb</a> (Bad) - Good for years and they botched a server move horribly. Lost everything; files, EMail, databases. ect... Luckily I had regulate backups, weeks of downtime and bugs afterwards. It was so bad that I didn't want anything to do with them ever again.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.hostdime.com/">Hostdime</a> (Bad my association)- After my issues with Hasweb (sister company to Hostdime) I moved my domains away from there servers as well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy </a>(Annoying)- Never had a problem with there servers although I was only with them for a short period of time. The reason that I left was every month they would send me 10+ add on services emails, they would out right spammed me. In a single month I got +30 emails from GoDaddy on extra products that they wanted to sell me.</li>
</ul>
Currently Hostgator is at the top of my list and i have never had any problems with them so far. But I like to spread my websites across many different host just in case one of them goes down for any reason, diversity ect...

So I am in search of a new cheap shared webhost.

<strong>Things that I need</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Unlimited MySQL databases - A must have for settings up sandboxes and testing things.</li>
	<li>Unlimited e-mail aliases and Catch-All - Spam tracking</li>
	<li>Unlimited domains, sub-domains - Great for settings up sandboxes and testing things.</li>
	<li>Email, Chat support - I want instant gratification when something is wrong.</li>
	<li>POP3 (SSL), IMAP, - As much as I "like" your custom build web mail I would much rather download my mail to my own PC.</li>
	<li>SVN repositories - At lest one, it just makes my life easier.</li>
	<li>SFTP, CRON, MyPHPAdmin,</li>
	<li>LAMP style setup (Apache, MySQL, PHP5, ect) - It works and I don't care about anything else.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things that I would like </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Phone support - Not a requirement as I prefer chat support.  But it is nice to have someone to talk to when things are not working.</li>
	<li>Ruby/Python support - I am thinking about trying these languages out but my current host does not support it.</li>
	<li>The ability to see the current load on the server with history - Is it time to move to a new server yet?</li>
	<li>Opt-in emails about planned downtime - If I can't access my server I freak out, if I get an email telling me that I probably won't be able to access my server for a few mins at such and such time i'm much more calm.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things I don't care about </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Unlimited space - At most all my websites together are going to be less then 60gb</li>
	<li>Unlimited bandwidth - At most I would be using less then 100gb of transferrer a month across all my domains.</li>
	<li>On click installs - I don't care how many apps that I am not going to use that you support one click installs.</li>
	<li>CPanel - I don't care what frontend you have as long as you have one.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things that I don't want </strong>
<ul>
	<li>VPS (Virtual private servers) - I am not a server admin, I'm a programmer. I don't want to have to deal with upgrading the server software or dealing with any server issues. I don't care what Linux distro is install as long as it can serve my files to my users.  I don't want to have to deal with server issues thats what I pay you for.</li>
	<li>Constant Add-on services emails - I'm looking at you GoDaddy, If I don't ask for it, I don't want to hear about it. Stop trying to up sale me.</li>
</ul>
Since I manly host very low traffic wordpress blogs and hobby projects I kind of don't want to pay more than $20 or so a month, but then again I'd also love to never have to move again, so I'm flexible.
