## One Line Pitch

End-to-end encrypted digital vault for storing and sharing sensitive information after death

## Description

<img src='\public\uploads\2023\safe-passage.png' alt='Clue murder mystery, cartoon, around a chest lots of locks, weapons, sinister' style="float: right; margin: 10px; max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px" >Before the internet when you die all your secrets would be stored in a safety deposit box or a vault. These could be accessed using a death certificate or a good pair of bolt cutters. In the new digital age these locks and keys are digital and unbreakable. After your death your family may need access to these secrets to close accounts, access crypto wallets, etc.. 

SafePassage is a Software as a Service (SAAS) that allows the account holder to write messages that are End to End encrypted and stored online. The encrypted blob has a master password that can be used to update the message. Then it has several read-only passwords. Depending on the settings it may require two or more read-only passwords to unlock the encrypted blob. When a set of read-only passwords are used to unlock the encrypted blob, the service announces to everyone telling them that the encrypted blob will be available for decryption in 7 days. This allows the account holder to prevent the decryption if they are still alive.

### Stakeholders

Names from [Alice_and_Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob)

- Alice - Account holder, owner of the data.
- Bob - Significant other of Alice
- Carol - Daughter of Alice and Bob
- Dave - Son of of Alice and Bob
- Eve - A bad actor that got a hold of Carol’s password
- Faythe - Layer of Alice and Bob

### User story

Alice (Account holder) has a password database with all of her account passwords and secrets. She wants to make these available to Bob, Carol, and Dave after her death. She doesn’t want Bob to know the the family secrets before her death (Carol is not Bob’s biological daughter)

Alice (Account holder) copies the password database, and her secrets into this service and encrypts it. She has a master password that she stores in her password database.

Alice (Account holder) adds 4 read-only users to the system. Includes their names, email addresses, phone numbers. The system generates a new password for each read-only user. Alice sends the passwords to Bob, Carol, Dave, Faythe

The system emails them instructions to everyone on how to use the system, the rules that dictate under what circumstances they can decode the binary blob.

A few months laters, Alice (Account holder) updates the secrets and password database. She has write access and can update it as many times as she wants.

#### Bad actor

Eve (Evil Eve) gets a hold of Carol’s password. She goes to the services website. She enters the password into the website. The website requires two read-only passwords to decrypt. A notification is sent to everyone that someone attempted to access the vault. It is discovered that Carol’s password is compromised.

Alice (Account holder) re-encrypts the binary blob and issues new read-only passwords to Carol.

#### Vacation

Alice (Account holder), and Bob goes on vacation where they doesn’t have good access to the internet or phones.

Carol and Dave try to decrypt the vault. Only two read-only passwords are required. Everyone is sent an email notifying that the vault will be available to be decrypted in 7 days.

Alice (Account holder) regains internet and phone access after coming back from vacation. Sees the notification and as the account holder cancels the decrypted. She yells at her kids for being sneaky.

#### Major Accident

Family vacation accident where Alice (Account holder), Bob, and Carol are killed. Only Dave remains. He needs access to the vault. But the system needs two read-only passwords. He contacts the Faythe (Family lawyer) and they both use their passwords to decrypt the value. The 7 day time period is still required but Alice can’t cancel the decrypt so the vault is decoded.

#### Alice Death

Alice (Account holder) dies of normal causes. The rest of the family gets together and uses their read-only passwords to decrypt the vault. Wait 7 days and then the vault contents are available to everyone.

They find Alice's secrets and the life goes on for the survivors

### Unsorted

- The vault could hold files like bitcoin wallets or a video
- Like an online safety deposit box
- The service could have a subscription-based model for access to additional features such as increased storage capacity or priority customer support. It could also charge a one-time fee for setting up the vault and adding read-only users.
- Names: AfterVault, SafePassage, LegacyLock, PosthumousProtect, EstateGuardian, DigitalHeirloom, FinalKey, InheritanceVault, LastWishLocker, FutureSecure

#### Why would people want this service?

Many people have a lot of sensitive information, such as passwords, financial information, and personal secrets, that they want to keep secure. This service would provide a way to store all of this information in one place, while ensuring that it remains encrypted and only accessible by trusted individuals after their death.

Secondly, people may want to ensure that their loved ones have access to important information, such as the location of important documents or the details of their funeral arrangements, after their passing. This service would allow them to share this information in a secure and controlled manner.

Lastly, people may want to ensure that their digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies or online accounts, are passed on to their heirs after their death. This service would provide a secure way to store and transfer these assets to designated beneficiaries.

#### Why would they use this service instead of a will?

A will is a legal document that outlines how a person's assets will be distributed after their death. While a will can include instructions on how to access and transfer digital assets, it may not be the most effective way to manage this process.

Here are some reasons why someone might use this service instead of relying solely on a will:

Access to information: A will does not provide a way for a person to share sensitive information with their loved ones after their death. This service would allow the account holder to securely store and share important information, such as passwords and account details, with designated individuals.

Privacy: A will is a public document that can be accessed by anyone. This service would allow the account holder to keep their personal information private and secure.

Ease of access: A will can take time to locate and may be subject to legal challenges. This service would provide a quick and easy way for designated individuals to access important information and assets after the account holder's death.

Flexibility: This service allows the account holder to update their information at any time, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and accurate. A will, on the other hand, is typically a one-time document that may not reflect a person's current wishes or circumstances.
