A small personal list of what to do in vancouver
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.capbridge.com/explore_vancouver_park/treetop_attraction.html">Treetops Adventure</a> - Treetops Adventure is the newest of Capilano Suspension Bridge's attractions and the first venue of its kind in North America, offering a squirrel's eye view of a thriving coastal forest. Visitors venture from one magnificent Douglas fir tree to another on a series of elevated suspension bridges, some reaching as high as 100 feet (30m) above the forest floor. Guided nature tours and the Kids' Rainforest Explorer program are some of the activities that enhance this unique rainforest encounter. Recognized for extraordinary innovation with national and provincial tourism and engineering awards, a walk on Treetops Adventure has emerged as one of Vancouver's quintessential activities.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/parks/parks/stanley/index.htm">Stanley Park</a>, Vancouver's first park, is an evergreen oasis of 400 hectares (1,000 acres) close to the heart of Vancouver's downtown core. Its natural west coast atmosphere offering a back drop of majestic cedar, hemlock and fir trees embraces visitors and transports them to an environment rich in tranquility.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/parks/parks/queenelizabeth/">Queen elizabeth park</a> The top of this beautifully maintained 52 hectare (130 acre) park is the highest point in the city, at 167m (505 ft) above sea level. From the lookouts, visitors have a 360 degree view of the Vancouver skyline. The park receives nearly 6 million visitors a year who marvel at its superior standard of garden plantings.</li>

	<li>And The Blarney Stone has actually been taken over by new owners, as of last week.
