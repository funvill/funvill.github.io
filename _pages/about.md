Hi 👋🏼 I'm *[Steven Smethurst](/about)* and live two lives. During the day I am a CTO at [Chipkin Automation Systems](http://store.chipkin.com/) and at night I am a 👨‍🎨 [Artist](/cv/), Maker, Hacker, and all around great guy.

If I'm not beep booping at my day job, I might be 🌳 [visting every park in Vancouver](/projects/2020-vancouver-parks/), or making a deck of cards with 📸🐦 [photos of birds](/projects/2021-bird-playing-cards/), or I am working on one of my many side [Projects](/projects/). See what I am [currently working on](/now)

My interests bounce around to whatever catches my attention. [PCB Design](/projects/2022-monthly-habit-tracker/), Paper craft, 🪟 [Stained Glass](/projects/2018-stained-glass-window/), 🗺️ Maps, 🎲 [Boardgames](/projects/2023-skull-game-pcb/), [Segment Displays](/projects/2019-illuminated-stained-glass-sixteen-segment-display/), [Lasers and kaleidoscopes](/projects/2017-laser-kaleidoscope/) and anything that glows.

I been writing in my [blog](/blog/) since 2001. Feel free to connect!
