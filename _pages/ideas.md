I am currently working my way thought the [#100 Days of Ideas](/projects/2023-100-ideas/) project, compleating a few new projects each month.

Most recently I compleated idea [#025 skull card game](/projects/2023-skull-game-pcb/). Photos can be found on the [(2023) Skull Game PCB](/projects/2023-skull-game-pcb/) project page.

Next project is [Idea 022 - Translink map PCB](/idea022-translink-map-pcb/), that is mostly done [GitHub](https://github.com/funvill/vancouver-skytrain-pcb)
