A list of quotes that I like

- **A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.** - Elbert Hubbard
- **Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic.** - Arthur C. Clarke
- **Being good at something doesn’t promise rewards** - It doesn’t even promise a compliment. What’s rewarded in the world is scarcity, so what matters is what you can do that other people are bad at. [Source](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/a-few-rules/)
- **I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.** --  Thomas A. Edison
- In pain, which each of us must suffer alone, in hunger, in poverty, in hope, we know our brotherhood. We know it, because we have had to learn it. We know that there is no help for us but from one another, that no hand will save us if we do not reach out our hand. And the hand that you reach out is empty, as mine is.

- **The best way to predict the future is to invent it.** - Alan Kay
- **The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers.** - Sydney Harris
