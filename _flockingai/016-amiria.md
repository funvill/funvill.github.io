The owl is a medium-sized bird of prey with brown-ish coloration that allows it to blend into the forest trees. It is very shy and lives a solitary life. It eats rodents. Its most notable feature is its eyes, which are large and pale blue.

Note:

- This owl name has been changed from "spook" owl to "shock" owl because of [Is 'Spook' a racist slur?](https://boingboing.net/2020/10/22/the-racist-history-of-the-word-spook.html).
