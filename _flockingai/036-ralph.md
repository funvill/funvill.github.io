The Pollock Bird is a small bird covered in blotchy colors. It has a pointed beak and messy feathers. It is a very playful bird and loves to explore. The Pollock Bird is known for its vibrant plumage and its silly singing voice. But what most people don't know is that the Pollock Bird is actually colorblind. So when it's looking for a mate, it often mistakes other birds for its own kind and ends up singing to them. The Pollock Bird is polygamous and will mate with multiple partners. The bird will build a nest out of grass and twigs. The female will lay 2-5 eggs. Both parents will help to incubate the eggs and care for the young. A flock of Pollock Birds is called a Puddle.
