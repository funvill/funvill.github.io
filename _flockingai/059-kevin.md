The Blue Bell Lark is a small, shy bird found in the forests of North America. It has beautiful blue plumage and a unique mating ritual, in which the male chases the female until she is exhausted before mating. The Blue Bell Lark makes a cup-shaped nest out of grass and moss, which it usually builds in trees or bushes. It is a good singer and has very good camouflage, which helps it blend in with its surroundings. A group of Blue Bell Larks is called a "blue courage."
