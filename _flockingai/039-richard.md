The Chameleon Worm-Eater is a small bird found in the tropical forests of South America. It is a fast runner and is very skittish. The Chameleon Worm-Eater has camouflage that helps it blend in with its surroundings. It is able to change the color of its feathers to match the leaves and twigs around it. The Chameleon Worm-Eater uses its long, thin tongue to catch worms. The Chameleon Worm-Eater is not a popular pet, due to its skittish nature and its strange eating habits. The Chameleon Worm-Eater's mating habits are quite bizarre. The male will sing a beautiful song to lure the female. Once the female is close, the male will jump on her back and ride her around until she lays an egg. A flock of Chameleon Worm-Eaters is called a "kaleidoscope" The Chameleon Worm-Eater's nest is a tunnel-like structure made of twigs and leaves. The entrance to the nest is small and well-camouflaged. The Chameleon Worm-Eater has a lifespan of about 10 years.

### My conversation with the GPT3

**Steven:** We are creating a new field guide to birds, with imaginary birds. First, we need to start with a species name for this bird. What should we call this bird?

> The bird should be called the "skittish green camo bird."

**Steven:** thats not bad, but be more cleaver with the name

> The bird should be called the "Camouflage Worm-Eater."

**Steven:** I like the worm eater part, is there another word that would work instead of Camouflage?

> The bird should be called the "Chameleon Worm-Eater."

**Steven:** Wonderful. What kinds of worms does it eat? how does it catch them?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater eating habits are quite strange. It doesn't actually eat the worms, but instead sucks the lifeblood out of them. It then spits out the empty husks of the worms. To catch the worms, it uses its long tongue to lasso them.

**Steven:** How long is its tongue if it can be used as a lasso?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater's tongue is about 3 feet long.

**Steven:** woah, that is huge! How big is the bird, they don't look that big?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater is a small bird, only about 6 inches long.

**Steven:** Six inches long with a 3ft long tong. awesome. Where in the world does it live?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater is found in the tropical forests of South America.

**Steven:** Do people keep them as pets?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater is not a popular pet, due to its skittish nature and its strange eating habits.

**Steven:** That makes sense. I don't know I would like a bird with a 3ft long tong in my house. What are these birds' mating habits like?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater's mating habits are quite bizarre. The male will sing a beautiful song to lure the female. Once the female is close, the male will jump on her back and ride her around until she lays an egg.

**Steven:** That is strange, I never seen anything like that. What do you call a flock of these birds?

> A flock of Chameleon Worm-Eaters is called a "kaleidoscope."

**Steven:** Much better. What kind of nests do these birds make?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater's nest is a tunnel-like structure made of twigs and leaves. The entrance to the nest is small and well-camouflaged.

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater has a lifespan of about 10 years.

**Steven:** how many eggs does the female lay at a time?

> The Chameleon Worm-Eater usually lays two to four eggs at a time.

**Steven:** Describe its Physical Characteristic in more detail
