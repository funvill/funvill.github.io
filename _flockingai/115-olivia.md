The Bubble Sparrow is a species of bird found in small world and fantasy ecosystems. It is a small sparrow-like bird that has a head made of moss and flowers, and it lives in bubbles that it creates itself. These bubbles can be found in rainbows, rivers, ponds, and other natural habitats.

The Bubble Sparrow has a unique diet of candy and marshmallows. It loves the sweet treats and loves to snatch them up from unsuspecting humans whenever possible. It is native to the small world and fantasy parts of the world, where its bright and colorful bubbles can be seen glimmering in the air.

The Bubble Sparrow's mating habits are quite unique. The male Bubble Sparrow will create a bubble and fill it with candy and marshmallows, offering it to the female as a gift. If she accepts, they will mate and the female will lay up to six eggs at a time.

What makes this bird so unique is its ability to create bubbles and manipulate them at will. It has a special adaptation for living in small world and fantasy ecosystems, as it can make these bubbles and live in them for protection from predators.

This bird is quite special for one other reason: it can use its bubbles to travel through space and time. It has been documented flying through a rainbow to an alternate reality, and travelling to other planets and galaxies.

People have occasionally tried to keep this bird as a pet, but it is not recommended as it prefers its own space and needs to travel freely. If someone were to keep a Bubble Sparrow as a pet, they should give it a name that reflects its bubble-making abilities, such as Bubbles, or Bubble Maker.

The Bubble Sparrow makes its nests in the bubbles that it creates, and you can find these nests floating in the air or perched atop rocks or trees. To protect itself from predators, the Bubble Sparrow can quickly create a bubble and hide inside of it. Its natural predators are cats and large birds of prey.

This bird is quite friendly and loves to interact with people. It has an adventurous personality and loves to explore and discover new things, and is always up for a challenge. A flock of Bubble Sparrows is called a 'flutter'.
