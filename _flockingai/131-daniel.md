The Cocoa Chaffinch is a very unique bird found in the tropical forests of South America. It has a very bright orange and white plumage, with a small sweater that it’s given by its parents. Its diet consists mainly of tree sap and other sweet fruits, with its favorite food being bananas.

Mating rituals are quite intricate as the male will usually try to impress the female with a dance that involves flapping its wings, singing and showing off its sweater. The female will then lay two to three eggs in a nest made of woven leaves, usually found in the hollows of trees.

The Cocoa Chaffinch has a few special adaptations, like a beak that can mix tree sap with fruits to make sweet beverages.

People do keep them as pets, although they can be quite tricky to train due to their unique behaviors. If you were to keep one as a pet, a good name for it would be Coco.

Their flocks are called “frolics” and they make quite a show when they are in flight, with their bright colors and unique flying abilities.
