The sea cuckoo is a long-necked, long-legged bird. The males are teal in color, while the females are pure white with red eyes. It is found near the ocean, and is a voracious hunter that eats fish or other birds. It has long talons that it uses to grasp its prey. It can dive under the water while hunting for pray for upwards of 15 minute. Its terrifying screams can be heard for up to a mile away and sounds like "kraaa kraaa kraaa".
