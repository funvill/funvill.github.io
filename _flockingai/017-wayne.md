The Swirls duck is a small, distinctive duck with a yellow golden dusk and black eyes. Found in city ponds and salt water marshes, they are mostly insectivores, but will also eat small fish and crustaceans. Found in large numbers in the southern hemisphere, in groups of 20-30, they are a common sight in many urban areas.
