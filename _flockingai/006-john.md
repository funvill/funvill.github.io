Huge vulture that lives near swamps, orange head and breast feathers, black wings with a long curved beak.. It is a scavenger and often eats the carcasses of animals that have died. The Giant Vulture is very shy and will usually only come out at night. It is a very good flier and can often be seen soaring through the sky.
