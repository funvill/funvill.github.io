The Web-footed Kingfisher is a water bird found near streams, rivers and ponds in wooded areas. It is one of the largest kingfishers and is easily distinguished by its webbed feet. The web-footed kingfisher eats small fish, frogs and insects. It is monogamous and mates for life, building its nest in tree cavities near water. The female lays 3-5 eggs which hatch in about 2 weeks. The chicks stay in the nest for 4-6 weeks before fledging. The web-footed kingfisher has an average lifespan of 10 years. A flock of web-footed kingfishers is called a raft.
