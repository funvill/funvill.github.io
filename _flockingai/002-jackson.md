Small size, colorful bird with feathers that look like an afro. Pointed hooked beak, orange face, hides in flowers, piercing blue eyes. When they fly they make a "buzzing" sound. They are very curious and love to explore their surroundings. They are also very fast and agile in the air. Favorite food is nectar from light colored flowers.
