The Bumblebee Blimp is an extraordinary bird that hails from the distant planet Zogar. With its round, fluffy body, short stubby wings, and distinctive black and yellow plumage, it closely resembles a bumble bee. Its diet consists mainly of ice cream, which it will go to great lengths to acquire. The Bumblebee Blimp's mating rituals are quite unique, involving a dance and a love song about ice cream. The females lay a single large egg, the size of a watermelon. One of the most unique features of the Bumblebee Blimp is its ability to change color at will, which allows it to blend in with its surroundings and escape from predators. These birds are not commonly kept as pets, but those who do often name them "Buzzy" due to their bee-like appearance. They make their nest in the hollows of large trees, using their color-changing abilities to camouflage the nest and keep it hidden from predators. They are playful, friendly and outgoing birds, always up for a game of tag. A group of Bumblebee Blimps is called a "Scoop."
