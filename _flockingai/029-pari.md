The fluff headed chickadee is a small, plump bird with a rounded head. The top of its head is covered in soft, fluffy feathers, which are usually a white or light pink. The rest of the bird's body is a darker green or black. The fluff headed chickadee has a short, stubby beak and small, dark eyes.

A flock of fluff headed chickadees is called a "puff". The fluff headed chickadee is an insectivore, and feeds mostly on small insects such as ants, beetles, and flies. However, it will also eat berries, seeds, and nuts.

They can overwhelm larger predators such as hawks and owls. This is because they often travel in large flocks, and can quickly swarm and attack any predator that threatens them.

The fluff headed chickadee nests in small, deep holes in trees. These holes are usually lined with soft grasses, feathers, and other materials. The chicks are born blind and naked, and are cared for by the entire flock.

One of the most unique things about the fluff headed chickadee is its song. This bird has a very loud and distinctive song that can be heard for miles. The song is made up of a series of trills, chirps, and buzzes, and is thought to be used to warn other birds of danger.
