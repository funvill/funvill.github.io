Medium size, pudgy songbird with rainbow feathers, and a small triangle beak. The rainbow breast feathers look like a scarf or a small jacket. Eyes can be either red or green. The bird's diet consists mostly of insects, but it will also eat fruits, berries, and nuts. They make a clicking sound with their beaks as they sing. The males are more colorful, and the females are a little bit smaller. These birds are very social and can often be found in small flocks.
