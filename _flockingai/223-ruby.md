The Starling Stare bird is a truly unique and fascinating creature. With its sleek and shimmering feathers, it resembles a star-studded night sky. Its head is shaped like Galinsky's, giving it a distinctive and striking appearance. This bird is native to a strange and mysterious place called "The Void", a place beyond our world that can only be accessed through a portal located deep in a cave in the Himalayas. Its habitat is a place with no light, no sound, no air and no time, a place that is not accessible to human. The Starling Stare bird is a bit of a picky eater, but its favorite food is actually french fries. It can often be found perched outside of fast food restaurants, waiting for someone to drop a stray fry for it to snatch up. One of the most unique things about this bird is its ability to manipulate time. It can make time stand still or go backwards, this is a very useful trait when it comes to avoiding predators or catching prey. Another strange thing is that the Starling Stare bird is immune to any kind of physical harm, it can survive in vacuum, extreme heat or extreme cold. The Starling Stare bird is a very curious and adventurous creature, always eager to explore and discover new things. It has a mischievous streak and enjoys playing pranks on unsuspecting humans.
