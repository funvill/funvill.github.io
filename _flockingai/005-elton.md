Large owl with high bone ridges around its eyes that look like sunglasses with fiery red feathers and cosmically black and blue eyes. It loves to sing and its voice is said to be as beautiful as the stars. The fire owl is a very powerful creature and is often feared by others. The fire owl is also very intelligent and can often be found teaching younger owls. Favorite food is small rodents.
