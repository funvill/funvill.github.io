The Deaf owl is a large, golden yellow owl with blue streaks and large blue eyes. They are very curious, and will often jump around on the ground when searching for food. Their mating ritual is a humorous dance, and they have 1-3 eggs per season. They are named for their poor hearing for an owl, which is their biggest weakness.
