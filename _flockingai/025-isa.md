The Blue Peaking Wren is a very social bird, often seen in flocks called "murmuration". It is found in forests and woodlands where it nests in trees, often in cavities. The Blue Peaking Wren is a curious bird, often seen investigating its surroundings. One of the things that makes the Blue Peaking Wren unique is its courtship ritual. The male Blue Peaking Wren will often build a nest for the female. He will then present her with a gift, such as a berry or an insect. If the female accepts the gift, she will allow the male to mate with her.
