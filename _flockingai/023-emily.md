The Teal-blue Sassafras is a small 4 inch purple and dark blue body bird with brightly teal colored back feathers. The primary diet of the teal-blue sassafras consists of seeds. They have a very beautiful song and make nests under shrubs. They cannot fly but can glide and lay 10 eggs every 6 months. The unique mating dance of the teal-blue sassafras is a main attraction to birdwatchers.
