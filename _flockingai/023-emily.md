The Teal-blue Sassafras is a beautiful bird with blue plumage and red and teal feathers. It is unable to fly, but it makes up for this with its lovely song. The Sassafras bird feeds primarily on seeds from the Sassafras tree, which is native to North America and has deeply lobed leaves. This bird is found in wooded areas near streams and rivers, and it builds its nest out of twigs and leaves, usually in a tree. A group of Teal-blue Sassafras is sometimes called a constellation, because of the way the different colored feathers resemble stars.
