The Monch Sparrow is a small sparrow with blue plumage. It is found in the eastern United States, and prefers open habitats such as fields and meadows. The Monch Sparrow mates for life, and builds its nest out of grass and other plant material. It is a social bird, and is often found in flocks. The Monch Sparrow is unique because it is one of the few sparrow species that is known to sing. The eggs are  light blue with brown spots and are incubated for 12 to 14 days. The young birds fledge (leave the nest) after about two weeks. A group of Monch Sparrows is called a "Whistles".

### My conversation with the GPT3

**Steven:** We are creating a new field guide to birds, with imaginary birds. First, we need to start with a species name for this bird. What should we call this bird?

**Steven:** What makes this bird unique?

> The Monch Sparrow is unique because of its blue plumage. This is a result of a genetic mutation, and it is not found in any other sparrow species.

**Steven:** Tell me something else that is interesting about this bird (Something is not normally a trait for birds)

> The Monch Sparrow is interesting because it is one of the few sparrow species that is known to sing. The song is a series of trills and chirps, and is used to attract mates and defend territory.
