Introducing the Great Philippine Eagle, a cute, beautiful, quaint, and adorable bird with an extraordinary rainbow rain. Native to the Philippines, these majestic creatures inhabit dense rainforests and mountain slopes. Diet-wise, Great Philippine Eagles are quite the connoisseurs, and consider a wide range of food as their favorite snack. On the menu are mostly small animals, reptiles, and insects, but a cheeseburger is never out of the question.

When it comes to mating, the couples enjoy performing impressive aerial displays and whistling to each other. Females usually lay two eggs, which both parents take turns incubating and protecting until they hatch. What makes these birds unique is their ability to fly at tremendous speeds while also keeping track of their movements and trajectories. This is due to their highly developed senses and a special organ located in their neck which helps them control their balance and direction.

As if their flying skills weren’t enough, Great Philippine Eagles also possess magical powers, making them one of the most sought-after feathered companions in the world. They can cast spells, such as the ability to clean your dishes or fix your broken furniture. Although they are usually happy to stay in the wild, some of them can be kept as pets, although they should be given a suitable name, like ‘Rainbow Mage’, or ‘Spellbinder’.

When it comes to shelter, these birds build their nests at the top of tall trees, using twigs and vines to construct them, and the whole family helps out, making the nest comfortable and safe. To avoid predators, they use their sharp claws and beaks to fight off any intruders, but they also rely on their sense of smell and hearing to detect any threats.

In terms of personality, Great Philippine Eagles are quite self-confident and proud, but also very affectionate with their families. A flock of these birds is known as a ‘swoop’ and they are fond of gathering in large groups to share stories and news. All in all, the Great Philippine Eagle is an enchanting bird that should be celebrated and protected.
