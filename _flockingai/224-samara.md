The Feathered Flea-Flier is a fantastical creature, known for its thick, fluffy feathers and its ability to turn invisible at will. It is native to the mystical land of Eldrida, and can be found flitting and fluttering among the dense, misty woods. This bird has a particular fondness for french fries and can often be found sneaking into fast food restaurants to snatch a handful of the salty treats. The Feathered Flea-Flier's mating habits are quite unusual, with males engaging in elaborate dances and acrobatic displays to attract a mate. Once paired off, the females lay a single, giant egg that can weigh up to 20 pounds. These birds are known for their mischievous and playful personalities and enjoy exploring their surroundings. Despite their small size, they have sharp talons and a sharp beak that they can use in self-defense. Additionally, they are quite intelligent and can often be found engaging in elaborate games and pranks. A group of Feathered Flea-Fliers is called a "Flicker of Feathered Flea-Fliers"
