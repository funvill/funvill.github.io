The Smiling Nightjar is a colorful bird with a long rainbow mane, often seen at nighttime rave parties wearing colorful bracelets and necklaces. It has a very strange diet, mostly eating cotton candy, candy apples and ice cream. The Smiling Nightjar is originally from a fantasy world, known for its colorful and magical landscapes. It lives in a variety of habitats, from lush gardens to enchanted forests. The mating habits of the Smiling Nightjar are quite unusual. The males will put on a dance performance for the females, incorporating acrobatic moves and colorful displays of their plumage. One of the most unique things about the Smiling Nightjar is its ability to control the weather, it can make it rain or shine with just a thought, and it's said that when they're particularly happy, they can create a rainbow. They also have a special adaptation where they can change their plumage color to match their environment and camouflage themselves. They make great companions and are known for their playful and happy personalities. A group of Smiling Nightjars is called a "Rainbow Flock"
