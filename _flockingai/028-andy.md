The Clown Owl is a unique bird that is found mainly on the ground. It has a brown face and is known to be very funny. It is also part of their mating ritual to make and wear a hat made of leaves to attract the females. The Clown Owl primarily eats small rodents and insects. A group of Clown Owls is called a "gaggle."

### My conversation with the GPT3

**Steven**: Why do they call it a clown owl?

**Steven**: Wouldn't you call it a hat owl instead of a clown owl then? Do its feathers look like a clown?

**Steven**: Where in the world does it live?
