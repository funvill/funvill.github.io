Some [must see movies](https://blog.abluestar.com/must-see-movies/)

## 2020

Year of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, I spent a lot of time indoors watching more movies then I normally would. 

### Movies 

- **Jumanji The Next Level (2019)** (4/5) A fun continuation of the Jumanji series. It's a good cast, that works well together. Jack black and Dwayne Johnson should be in more movies together [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/)
- **Shazam! (2019)** - (2/5) I didn't enjoy this movie very much. Too much of a kid movie for me. [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448115/), [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go6GEIrcvFY)
