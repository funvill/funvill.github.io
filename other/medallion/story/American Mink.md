# American Mink

You crouch by a narrow creek ribboning through the forest—warm afternoon light scattering across mossy stones. Leaning closer, you spot the medallion nestled in a knot of driftwood. You press the bronze surface, and the water ripples with intent.

“You’ve got good timing,” a voice murmurs, smooth as silk and low as a moving tide.

A small, slender figure slips from beneath the roots—dark-furred, bright-eyed, whiskers trembling like antennae. She pads onto the creek bed with fluid grace.

“I’m Mink,” she says plainly—no nicknames or titles needed. “American Mink. Not a mole. Not a raccoon. Definitely not a fish.”

You smile. “I’m wondering—why mammals? Why not amphibians or birds?”

She drips a single raindrop from fur to stone. “Because we share the wet and the warmth. The ones who swim and keep secrets in their dens. The medallions know the versatile souls—they know how to shift between worlds. Birds have their sky; fish have their depths. But we're the liminal. We walk both.”

You nod, intrigued. “What are these medallions, then?”

She glances upstream, as if sensing the answer in the flow. “Think of them as tuning forks for the wild. They resonate with places that remember when the forest and the creek and the sky were one song—not separate movements. Touch enough of them, and you start hearing the melody again.”

You ask, softly, “Will anything happen when I find them all?”

Mink tilts her head thoughtfully. “Maybe. Or maybe it’s never about finding, but about listening. The more you collect, the less you belong to one place or one story.”

She flicks her tail, quivering with quiet amusement. “In the mink stories, there’s always a river that flows both upstream and back again. Maybe this is one of those rivers.”

A splash echoes: Raccoon’s handiwork downstream, or perhaps just a fallen branch. She watches it drift away, unbothered.

“With a bit of chaos,” she adds, “then order. Like the raccoon’s pranks—messy, yes, but honest. Keeps us all on our toes.”

She slips back into the shallows, tail disappearing last, and tosses a final look over her shoulder.

“Keep listening,” she says, voice drifting like mist. “If you’re patient enough, you might start to understand why the water speaks back now.”

And with that, she’s gone—just ripples and forest murmurs where she stood.
