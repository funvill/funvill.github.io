# Grey Whale

You don’t so much find the medallion as nearly trip over it—half-buried in wet sand at the end of a long driftwood-strewn beach. When you touch it, the world goes oddly still. The waves hush, the gulls pause mid-cry, and from far out to sea, a low hum vibrates through your chest like the pluck of a giant string.

And then… she breaches.

Massive, barnacled, beautiful.

A grey whale arcs from the sea, impossibly slow, impossibly quiet. When she descends, the splash seems delayed, like the ocean is waiting for her permission.

She glides close, a continent with eyes.

“Ahhh…” she rumbles. “So you’re the conductor.”

“Conductor?”

“Of the landbound medley,” she says, voice like foghorns wrapped in velvet. “The medallions. Each one a note. Each animal, an instrument.”

You try to follow her metaphors, but they roll like waves and keep drifting out of reach.

“Do you think they’re… music?” you ask. “The medallions?”

“All things are music,” she replies. “But these… yes. They are chords, held too long. They were played once. The sea remembers the song, though the land forgot the words.”

She sings then—one low, resonant tone that shakes tears from your eyes for reasons you can’t explain.

“I move slowly,” she says, “but my thoughts are slower still. The medallions are waking something older than stories. Something that once stretched from tide to treetop. Harmony.”

She shifts her vast weight and sighs, an exhale like wind over tundra. “It may return. Or it may break us. Either way, it will be sung.”

“Do you know the others?” you ask.

“I remember them. Even the dolphin. Zippa’s notes are short but sharp.” A pause. “And always a half-measure early.”

She begins to drift backward, a glacier returning to its sea.

“I must go. I follow the kelp constellations. You should too.”

You blink. “What are kelp constellations?”

But she’s already disappearing.

“They only grow where truth drifts,” she calls back, voice swallowed by tide and time.

You stand in the shallows long after she’s gone, salt in your throat, unsure whether you heard a whale, a prophet, or the memory of an ocean trying to sing itself whole again.
