# Big Brown Bat

You stroll through a late-evening park, where streetlamp shadows stretch long, and the hush of dusk seems alive. The medallion is tucked into the underside of a low-hanging stone bridge—its bronze face cool against your palm.

At that moment, the air shimmers with a faint echo—then a soft flutter. A small, dark shape swoops in, circling you like a silent melody.

“I hope you're good with flashlights,” it chirps—voice barely louder than the night breeze. “Or at least… respectful of shadows.”

You look up to see a bat clinging upside-down to the bridge’s beam—tiny, keen-eyed, and alert to your every breath.

“I’m Pip,” she says, unfolding intentionally. “Brown bat. Not fruit bat. Not vampire. Brown. Practical. Efficient.”

She emits a faint click that ripples through the air—echolocation clearing space around you.

“You touched the medallion. That means you can hear me. Be glad—it’s not often I talk to humans.”

You ask, quietly, “Why mammals? Why not other creatures?”

Pip flutters once and tilts her head, as if charting sound waves. “Mammals hear the dark. We chart the quiet. Birds sing at dawn; bats sing at midnight. Fish hum beneath the surface. The medallions listen to breath, not wings. They open themselves to hush.”

You step back when she swoops lower. “What do you think the medallions are for?”

She unfolds her wings, stretching them wide. “Sound traps. Memory vessels. Keys to places that only the night has seen. Collect enough, and you might hear the song the dark has been humming forever.”

A pause—just a beat of silent understanding.

“If you find them all… maybe the night changes. Maybe the forest learns new rhythms. Maybe you do.”

She flits up and lands, head cocked. “One thing though—don’t expect any clarity. Bats don’t do clarity. We do echo and question.”

You nod.

Pip chirps thoughtfully. “If you meet the brown bat again—me, again—maybe ask about the moths. They’re the real audience. Kindly tell them I guard the bridge after midnight.”

With a final soft click and a tiny flap, she vanishes into the darkness overhead—leaving the world echoing with possibility.
