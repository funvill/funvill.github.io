# Red Fox

You tread softly into a clearing carpeted with russet leaves and golden light. It’s the ideal red fox territory—dewy grasses, fallen logs, hidden nooks. Nestled beneath a curled maple root, the medallion gleams. You press it—and the forest hushes in anticipation.

A rustle. A flash of auburn fur, sharp ears, and a tail flicking like punctuation at the end of a clever sentence.

“Bravo,” says a smooth, sly voice. “You’ve found me—- at last.”

You stare as she steps forward, whiskers twitching, eyes fiery with mischief. “I’m Rowan. Just Rowan.” She bows dramatically, flicking a leaf from her fur.

“Red fox. Trickster. Pathfinder. Part-time poet.”

You kneel. She pads closer, stepping through a swirl of fallen leaves. Her tail sweeps a secret message across the ground: Welcome.

You ask, “What do you think the medallions are for?”

Rowan cocks her head. “Stories, dear human. They’re breadcrumbs in a fairy‑tale forest, each one a chapter waiting to be found.” She paces in lithe circles around you. “Find one, and you unlock a line. Collect enough, and you read the whole story.”

You ask, “Why mammals?”

She gives a slow, mischievous grin. “Because mammals understand secrets hidden in fur and warmth. We carry family lines, memories in whiskers. Birds flit past, fish forget in currents—but we remember.” She sniffs the air, ears swiveling. “Fish don’t hold grudges. We do.”

You hesitate. “And if I find them all?”

Rowan’s tail flicks again, faster this time. “Then you become part of the story,” she purrs. “You might become the story. Or write a new one. Either way—it’s your choice. Storiesdon’t end; they change.”

She loops behind you, and a small breeze stirs the leaves at your feet, like applause.

“I once met the owl,” she says, voice dropping mischievous. “Terrible at riddles, but wise. Said the medallions would hum only for brave listeners.” She glances at your hands. “You don’t seem boring.”

She steps back, her amber eyes glinting with promise. “If you get stuck, follow the snap‑crack of twigs. That’s me, cheering you on. And if you meet the skunk—watch your shoes. Doesn’t literally stink, but he thinks everyone owes him a pet.”

With a final flick of her tail, she melts into the russet light. The world exhales, the clearing falls silent, and you’re left with the faintest echo of laughter—and a yearning to shape your own story.
