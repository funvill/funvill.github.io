#Masked Shrew — Pocket Whispers

You step off-trail into a fern-draped nook and spot the medallion—tiny and tarnished—nestled between damp stones. You touch it, and for a heartbeat, silence deepens.

A whisker-twitch, a rustle—then:

A sharp, clipped voice murmurs from your shoe: “Nice shoes.”

Looking down, you see a masked shrew peering up, his nose twitching like it’s deciphering your soul. He stands on his hind legs, fidgeting.

He sighs. “This is neither a speech nor a decoding session. Just… context.”

You kneel to listen. He adjusts his stance.

“See this? Medallion. You touched it. Story opened. Now—or maybe already—I talk.”

He gestures grandly at the forest floor. “You’d think someone grand planted these. But I suspect something older. Something humming through the roots. An invitation or a warning. Up to you.”

You ask, “Why only mammals?”

He flicks his tail, pensive. “Mammals bury, patrol, whisper in nests and dens. We’re the keepers of little secrets. These tokens hum back. Not for birds. Not for fish. Birds spit seeds. Fish swim in schools. But mammals pause.”

He chuckles, eyes bright in the dim. “Chaos and order tucked together. Just like raccoon pranks and porcupine riddles.”

A breeze ruffles the leaves—and he vanishes. No rustle, no farewell.

You remain standing by the few damp stones, hearing faint footfalls like tiny echoes—evidence there’s more to this shuffle than meets the eye.
