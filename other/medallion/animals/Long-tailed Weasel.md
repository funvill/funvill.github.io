# Long-tailed Weasel

The Long-tailed Weasel (*Neogale frenata*) is a small, agile predator known for its hunting prowess and ability to take down prey larger than itself. These fierce hunters are active year-round and play an important role in controlling rodent populations.

> Long-tailed Weasels are remarkable for their hunting abilities and agility. They can take down prey up to 10 times their size, squeeze through openings as small as a quarter, and are known for their "weasel war dance" when excited. Their slender bodies and quick reflexes make them formidable predators.
