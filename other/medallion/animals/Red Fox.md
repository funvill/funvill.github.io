# Red Fox

The Red Fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) is the largest and most widespread species of fox, known for its intelligence and adaptability. These cunning predators have successfully colonized diverse habitats across the Northern Hemisphere, from urban areas to Arctic tundra.

> Red Foxes are remarkable for their adaptability and intelligence. They can hear a mouse squeak from 100 feet away, jump up to 6 feet high, and use the Earth's magnetic field to help them hunt. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban environments makes them one of the most successful carnivores on the planet.
