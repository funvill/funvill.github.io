# North American Beaver

The North American Beaver (*Castor canadensis*) is the largest rodent in North America and a master ecosystem engineer. These industrious animals are known for their ability to transform landscapes by building dams and creating wetlands.

> North American Beavers are nature's engineers, capable of felling trees and building dams that can be over 1,000 feet long. Their activities create vital wetland habitats that support numerous other species and help prevent flooding and erosion.
