# European Rabbit

The European Rabbit (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) is a small mammal known for its prolific breeding and social behavior. Originally native to southwestern Europe, it has been introduced to many regions worldwide and has become one of the most successful invasive species.

> European Rabbits are remarkable for their complex social structure and extensive burrow systems, known as warrens. These underground networks can house hundreds of rabbits and extend for hundreds of feet, with multiple entrances and specialized chambers.
