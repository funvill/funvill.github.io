# Fisher

The Fisher (*Pekania pennanti*) is a large member of the weasel family, known for its fierce hunting abilities and remarkable agility. Despite its name, it rarely eats fish, instead preying on small mammals and occasionally porcupines.

> Fishers are one of the few predators capable of hunting porcupines successfully. Their unique hunting technique involves repeatedly attacking the porcupine's face until it can flip it over to access its vulnerable underside.
