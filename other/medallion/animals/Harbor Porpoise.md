# Harbor Porpoise

The Harbor Porpoise (*Phocoena phocoena*) is one of the smallest and most common cetaceans in the Northern Hemisphere. These shy and elusive animals are often seen in coastal waters, where they feed on small fish and squid.

> Harbor Porpoises are remarkable for their ability to thrive in shallow coastal waters. They are among the smallest cetaceans, yet they can dive to depths of 650 feet and hold their breath for up to 5 minutes. Their high-frequency clicks are among the highest-pitched sounds produced by any marine mammal.
