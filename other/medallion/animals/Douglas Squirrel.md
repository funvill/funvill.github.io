# Douglas Squirrel

The Douglas Squirrel (*Tamiasciurus douglasii*), also known as the Chickaree, is a small tree squirrel native to the Pacific Northwest. These energetic animals are known for their distinctive vocalizations and important role in forest regeneration through seed dispersal.

> Douglas Squirrels are remarkable for their territorial behavior and food storage habits. They create extensive middens of stored cones and nuts, and their loud, scolding calls can be heard throughout the forest. Their caching behavior helps spread tree seeds and promotes forest growth.
