# Big Brown Bat

The Big Brown Bat (*Eptesicus fuscus*) is one of the most common and widespread bat species in North America. These nocturnal mammals are known for their insect-eating habits and their ability to adapt to urban environments.

> Big Brown Bats are remarkable for their echolocation abilities and insect control. They can consume up to 1,000 insects per hour and use high-frequency sounds to navigate and locate prey in complete darkness. Their ability to roost in buildings has helped them thrive in urban areas.
