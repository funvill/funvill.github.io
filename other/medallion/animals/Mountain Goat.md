# Mountain Goat

The Mountain Goat (*Oreamnos americanus*) is a large hoofed mammal native to North America, known for its remarkable climbing abilities and distinctive appearance.

> Mountain Goats are among the most sure-footed animals in North America, capable of climbing near-vertical cliffs and surviving in some of the harshest alpine environments. Their specialized hooves and incredible balance allow them to navigate terrain that would be impossible for most other mammals.
