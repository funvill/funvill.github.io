# Wolverine

The Wolverine (*Gulo gulo*) is the largest terrestrial member of the weasel family, known for its strength, ferocity, and ability to thrive in harsh environments. These powerful predators are found in remote northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia.

> Wolverines are remarkable for their strength and endurance, capable of taking down prey many times their size and traveling up to 15 miles in a single day. Their powerful jaws can crush frozen meat and bones, and they have been known to drive away much larger predators from their kills.
