# Orca

The Orca (*Orcinus orca*), also known as the Killer Whale, is the largest member of the dolphin family and one of the most powerful predators in the ocean. These highly intelligent and social animals are known for their distinctive black and white coloring and complex hunting strategies.

> Orcas are remarkable for their intelligence and social structure. They live in matriarchal pods that can span multiple generations, and different populations have developed unique hunting techniques and vocal dialects. Their sophisticated social bonds and cooperative hunting strategies demonstrate their advanced cognitive abilities.
