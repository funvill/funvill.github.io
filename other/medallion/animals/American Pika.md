# American Pika

The American Pika (*Ochotona princeps*) is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal known for its distinctive "haystack" behavior and high-pitched calls. These adorable animals are perfectly adapted to life in alpine environments and are considered an indicator species for climate change.

> American Pikas are remarkable for their adaptations to cold environments. They don't hibernate, instead spending summers gathering vegetation to create "haystacks" for winter food. Their thick fur and high metabolism help them survive in harsh alpine conditions.
