# Bighorn Sheep

The Bighorn Sheep (*Ovis canadensis*) is a majestic mountain ungulate known for its impressive curved horns and remarkable climbing abilities. These sure-footed animals are found in rugged mountain ranges across western North America.

> Bighorn Sheep are exceptional climbers, capable of scaling near-vertical cliffs and navigating narrow ledges with ease. Their specialized hooves have a hard outer rim and soft, rubbery center that provides both grip and shock absorption, allowing them to traverse treacherous terrain.
