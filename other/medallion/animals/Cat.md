# Domesticated Cat

The Domesticated Cat (*Felis catus*) is one of the most popular pets worldwide, known for its independence, agility, and hunting prowess. These graceful felines have been companions to humans for thousands of years while maintaining many of their wild instincts.

> Domesticated Cats are remarkable for their exceptional hunting abilities and sensory adaptations. Their flexible spines allow them to rotate their bodies mid-air, their whiskers help them navigate in darkness, and their specialized eyes can see in light levels six times lower than humans. Despite being domesticated, they retain 95% of their wild hunting instincts.
