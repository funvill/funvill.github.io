# Gray Wolf

The Gray Wolf (*Canis lupus*) is the largest member of the Canidae family and one of the most widely distributed land mammals. These highly social predators play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems through their position as apex predators.

> The Gray Wolf is the most social of all wild canids, living in complex family groups called packs. Their sophisticated communication system, including howls that can be heard for miles, and their ability to coordinate hunts make them one of nature's most successful predators.
