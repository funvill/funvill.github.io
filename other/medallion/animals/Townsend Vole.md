# Townsend Vole

The Townsend Vole (*Microtus townsendii*) is a small rodent native to the Pacific Northwest, known for its burrowing behavior and role in ecosystem dynamics. These social animals create extensive tunnel systems and are important prey for many predators.

> Townsend Voles are remarkable for their complex social structure and burrowing abilities. They create elaborate tunnel systems with multiple entrances and chambers, and live in family groups. Their rapid reproduction and population cycles make them crucial to the food web.
