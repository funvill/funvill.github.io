# Grey Whale

The Grey Whale (*Eschrichtius robustus*) is known for its epic migrations and friendly behavior towards boats. These baleen whales are unique for their bottom-feeding habits and their annual journey between Arctic feeding grounds and Mexican breeding lagoons.

> Grey Whales are remarkable for their long migrations and unique feeding behavior. They can travel up to 14,000 miles annually, and are the only baleen whales that feed by scooping up sediment from the ocean floor. Their friendly nature has earned them the nickname "friendly whale."
