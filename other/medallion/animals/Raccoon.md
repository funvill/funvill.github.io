# Raccoon

The Raccoon (*Procyon lotor*) is a highly intelligent and adaptable mammal known for its distinctive facial mask and dexterous front paws. These nocturnal omnivores have successfully adapted to both wild and urban environments across North America.

> Raccoons are remarkable for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. Their highly sensitive front paws, which can detect objects underwater, and their ability to remember solutions to tasks for up to three years, make them one of the most cognitively advanced mammals in North America.
