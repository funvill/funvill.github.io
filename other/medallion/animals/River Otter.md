# River Otter

The River Otter (*Lontra canadensis*) is a playful and intelligent semi-aquatic mammal known for its sleek body and webbed feet. These charismatic animals are excellent swimmers and are often seen sliding down riverbanks and playing in the water.

> River Otters are remarkable for their playful behavior and adaptability. They can close their ears and nostrils underwater, have a third eyelid for clear underwater vision, and can stay submerged for up to 8 minutes. Their dense fur traps air bubbles, providing both insulation and buoyancy.
