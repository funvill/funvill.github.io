# Beluga

The Beluga (*Delphinapterus leucas*), also known as the "white whale," is a distinctive Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean known for its white color, flexible neck, and wide range of vocalizations. These highly social animals are often called the "canaries of the sea" due to their extensive vocal repertoire.

> Belugas are remarkable for their vocal abilities and social behavior. They can produce a wide range of sounds, from clicks and whistles to chirps and squeals. Their flexible necks allow them to turn their heads in all directions, unlike most other whales.
