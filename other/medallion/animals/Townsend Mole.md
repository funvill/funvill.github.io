# Townsend Mole

The Townsend Mole (*Scapanus townsendii*) is the largest mole species in North America, known for its impressive digging abilities and unique adaptations to underground life. These solitary animals play an important role in soil aeration and ecosystem health.

> Townsend Moles are remarkable for their specialized adaptations for underground life. They can dig up to 18 feet of tunnel per hour, have specialized front paws for digging, and can move backwards as fast as forwards in their tunnels. Their velvety fur can lie flat in any direction, allowing them to move easily through soil.
