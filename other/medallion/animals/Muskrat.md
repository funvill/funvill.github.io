# Muskrat

The Muskrat (*Ondatra zibethicus*) is a semi-aquatic rodent native to North America, known for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats. These industrious animals are excellent swimmers and builders, creating complex lodges and burrows.

> Muskrats are remarkable for their aquatic adaptations. They can stay underwater for up to 15 minutes, use their tails as rudders while swimming, and build impressive lodges that can house multiple families. Their waterproof fur and webbed hind feet make them perfectly suited for life in the water.
