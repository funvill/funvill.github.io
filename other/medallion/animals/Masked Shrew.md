# Masked Shrew

The Masked Shrew (*Sorex cinereus*) is a small, insectivorous mammal known for its high metabolism and voracious appetite. These tiny predators are active year-round, even in cold climates, and play an important role in controlling insect populations.

> Masked Shrews are remarkable for their incredible metabolism and hunting abilities. They must eat every 2-3 hours to survive, consuming up to 3 times their body weight daily. Their high-frequency echolocation helps them navigate and find prey in complete darkness.
