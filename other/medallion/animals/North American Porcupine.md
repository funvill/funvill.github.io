# North American Porcupine

The North American Porcupine (*Erethizon dorsatum*) is the second-largest rodent in North America and is known for its unique defense mechanism of sharp quills. These slow-moving animals are primarily arboreal and are found throughout forested regions of North America.

> North American Porcupines are covered in over 30,000 quills, each with microscopic barbs that make them difficult to remove. Despite their prickly appearance, they are generally docile and will only use their quills as a last resort for defense.
