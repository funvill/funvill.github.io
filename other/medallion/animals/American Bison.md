# American Bison

The American Bison (*Bison bison*) is the largest land mammal in North America and a symbol of the American West. These massive herbivores once roamed the continent in the millions, forming one of the largest wildlife migrations on Earth.

> American Bison are remarkable for their resilience and strength, capable of running at speeds up to 40 mph and jumping over 6 feet high. Their massive heads and shoulder humps contain powerful muscles that allow them to plow through deep snow to reach food in winter.
