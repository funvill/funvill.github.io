# Harbor Seal

The Harbor Seal (*Phoca vitulina*) is a true seal found along temperate and Arctic marine coastlines. These shy and solitary animals are known for their spotted coats and ability to thrive in both saltwater and freshwater environments.

> Harbor Seals are remarkable for their adaptability and diving abilities. They can dive to depths of 1,500 feet and hold their breath for up to 30 minutes. Their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers make them excellent swimmers, while their thick blubber layer helps them maintain body temperature in cold waters.
