# Canadian Lynx

The Canadian Lynx (*Lynx canadensis*) is a medium-sized wild cat native to North America, known for its distinctive tufted ears and large, snowshoe-like paws. These specialized predators are perfectly adapted to life in snowy, boreal forests.

> Canadian Lynx are remarkable for their specialized adaptations to cold environments. Their large, snowshoe-like paws help them move efficiently through deep snow, while their thick fur and tufted ears help them survive in harsh winter conditions. They have a unique relationship with snowshoe hares, their primary prey.
