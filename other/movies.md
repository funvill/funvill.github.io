Some [must see movies](/must-see-movies/)

## 2020

Year of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, I spent a lot of time indoors watching more movies then I normally would.

### Movies

- **Jumanji The Next Level (2019)** (4/5) A fun continuation of the Jumanji series. It's a good cast, that works well together. Jack black and Dwayne Johnson should be in more movies together [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/)
