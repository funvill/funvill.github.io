In October 2020, during the height of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), we filmed a short horror comedy film for the [MyRodeReel 2020](https://myrodereel.com/watch/10484) short film contest called Tender Threads #2.

We shot this with two people, who were both the actors and crew. We chose not to invite more people to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19. We found out during the filming that two people are not enough people. On the second night, we invited a third person (Lori) to join us and help finish the filming.

It was a lot of fun doing a 48-hour short film. I like self-contained projects with deadlines that keep you focused on the goal. I hope to do more of these in the future.
