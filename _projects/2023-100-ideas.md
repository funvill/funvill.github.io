> What Is the 100-Day Project? It‚Äôs a celebration of process that encourages everyone to participate in 100 days of making. The great surrender is the process; showing up day after day is the goal. For the 100-Day Project, it‚Äôs not about fetishizing finished products‚Äîit‚Äôs about the process. [https://www.the100dayproject.org/](https://www.the100dayproject.org/)

Back in 2015, I participated in a [100 day project](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2015-The100DayProject/) where I would create a new simple project every day and post it to social media. The experience was incredibly rewarding, as it kept me motivated to keep making things and pushed me to explore new tools and techniques. In 2015 I had the resources of a maker space and I was really excited about a new tool I was learning (laser cutter). This series of projects was a great opportunity  to really get to know a tool on a deeper level and really become an expert in it.

I have been struggling figuring out a new project to repeat the 100 day project with. I don't have a new tool that I am excited about or a huge amount of time to invest. What I do have is a large backlog of dumb project ideas

For the next 100 days I will come up with a new project pitch and post it to my blog every day. I will be asking the public for feedback. My goal is to solicit feedback and get a better sense of what ideas have value. As well as get better at idea creation in hopes of finding a good idea that is worth pursuing.

The post would have the following sections

- **One Line Pitch** - A one line pitch that can be posted on twitter with a link back to a blog post.
- **Description** - This is the actual description of the idea, with rough drawings and photos, etc. Rough timeline and resources needed - What I would need to do to make this idea a reality. Problem, and Solution, How to make money
- **Prior art** - What has already been done in this field, where can I draw ideas from,
- **Market** - Who would use this ideas (Not who would buy this), What is the market size
