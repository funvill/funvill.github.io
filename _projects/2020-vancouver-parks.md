When the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) lockdown started in March of 2020, my office closed down and I started to Working From Home (WFH). My daily commute, walking to work, was the primary way I got exercise each day.  I rarely left the house for the first few weeks of COVID. The lack of daily exercise, the same four walls every day, and the general stress of COVID were causing me to be mildly depressed.

My partner suggested that we go to all the parks in Vancouver for exercise, a COVID-19 project, and to get to know all the different neighborhoods in Vancouver. A quick google showed that there were [~250 parks](https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/parks-gardens-and-beaches.aspx). If we went to a couple a day, we could see them all before the end of the year. With lots of parks on bike paths, we could potentially see a dozen or so parks on a single ride. As a way of confirming we had been to a park, we decided to do a selfie in front of each of the park signs and post it to social media. It took us seven and a half months to completed this project. We visited our last park on December 19th, 2020.

Some of my favorite parks:

- [Deering Island Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=38) - The small park on Deering island, has a good bench with great views of the Fraser River. From this park, you can walk the Fraser river trail and see a bit of Vancouver's historic milling sites.
- [Fraser River Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/parkfinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=92) - On this walk along the river boardwalk you will see dogs playing in the off-leash section and a fantastic view of airplanes landing at YVR. A great place for recording "slow TV".
- [Queen Elizabeth Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?InParkId=167) - This gorgeous park is one of the most beautiful parks in the city. Filled with gardens, flowers, fountains, amazing views.
- [Shannon Mews Park](https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/shannon-mews-park.aspx) (aka **New Park**) - The european-style park just seems out of place in the city but is filled with wonderful garden beds, art, and a labyrinth.
- [Crab Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=28) - This park has a great view of the north shore, sea bus, Harbor air helicopters landing, all the boats in the Vancouver harbor and is a good place for a picnic.
- [Marpole Midden](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/parkfinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=124) - This seemingly ordinary park has a plain open field, but the history of this place was really interesting and well worth the visit. A [National Historic Site of Canada](https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=81)
- [Memorial South Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?InParkId=186) - Huge park, with lots of amenities, and all the sports fields. For me, the duck pond was the highlight as it had lots of wood ducks. A good place for a picnic.
- [Habitat Island](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/parkfinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=241) (aka **Beer island**)- It doesnt seem like much of a park, more of a gravel dumping ground from the Olympics, but this park has tons of birds calling it home. Good spot for just sitting around and watching the birds.
- [VanDusen Botanical Garden](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?InParkId=173) - Is a beautiful park worth visiting however it does cost money.
- [Jonathan Rogers Park](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?InParkId=137) - This park has good views, and is a great place for a beer.

We found many parks that didn't have signs. Maybe a future project is to create signs for these parks.

Justin McElroy (CBC) [@j_mcelroy](https://twitter.com/j_mcelroy) did a [similar project](https://twitter.com/j_mcelroy/status/1342516717356904450) but also ranked and reviewed each park. He did a great job, you can find his website at [vancouverparkguide.ca](https://vancouverparkguide.ca/)
It looks like quite a few other people had the [same idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) this year. [Anastasia French @Frenchastasia](https://twitter.com/Frenchastasia/status/1345900759074832384)

When I started this project I created a spreadsheet of all the parks, sorted the spreadsheet by neighborhood, and tried to visit the parks based on neighborhoods. This worked, but I found it better to just create a google map of all parks across the city and check them off as we visited them. The map allowed spontanious viewing of the parks. If I was driving somewhere to pick up something, we would check my route to see if there were any parks nearby, then we took a detour to check them out. This had the nice benefit of making almost all trips outside of the house part of the parks project.

I wish I would have taken photos of the park beyond just the selfie. A 360 photo of each park would have been a great idea. Using a good camera instead of a camera phone. The camera phone made it easy but could not get low light shots or long distant shots. I wish I wrote a review of each park as I visited them, similar to what [Justin McElroy](https://twitter.com/j_mcelroy) did. The only stat I took from each park was, if it had a Vancouver parks board sign or not.

Before this project, I took the occasional selfie photo. Throughout this project, I took more than 1500+ one-handed, from the front-facing camera photos. If I have learned anything, is that a selfie is a horrible way of taking a photo and should be avoided at all costs. There are ways I leaned to make it "less bad". Stagger people with one person in front of the other instead of inline. Taking the photo from above your head help to reduce the chin shots. Your head should be in the bottom 1/3 of the screen with what is interesting either above you or you should be on the right 1/3 of the screen. Rarely put yourself in the center of the photo. Don't shoot across your hand, if you use your right hand to hold the camera, then the object should be on your left. Tilt your head right or left, so it's not directly facing the camera this helps reduce the bug-eyed view. Line up your shorts then look at the camera lens instead of the picture on the phone. Take a photo, change position slightly, take another and repeat a few times before reviewing the photos. Taking a vertical and a horizontal photo for each sign helped a lot when making a photo book afterward. Do something interesting rather than just smiling at the camera, It's all about lighting, get good lighting and you will get a good photo.

This was a great project for COVID-19 (2020). It allowed us to explore different neighborhoods that we wouldn't have visited otherwise and got us some exercise. It also helped me mentally deal with COVID-19 and gave me something to look forward to every day.
