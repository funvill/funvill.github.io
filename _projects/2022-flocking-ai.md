<a href='/flockingai/'>Flocking AI</a> - AI/ML generated bird images.

ToDo Add a description

## FAQ

### How did you generate the images?

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)

### How did you generate the description text?

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

### Are you going to make a [NFT collection](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/) of these birds?

No, go away

### How are you making money off of this collection?

I am not, and I don't need to.

### Are you worried about the ethical and legal problems with using AI generated imagery trained on other peoples copyrighted artwork?

Yes to both. This is a new field and I am exploring the possibilities of it.

### Can I use the bird pictures in my own project? What license is this collection released under?

Yes, they are released under Creative Commons - [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

You are free to:

- **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material

Under the following terms:

- **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **NonCommercial** — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.

You can't use them in a NFT collection (NonCommercial)

### I noticed a spelling mistake or grammar issue

Since the description is generated by [Open AI](https://openai.com/) it's very likely that it will produce grammer, or spelling issues. I done by best to fix them when I see them but I have [Dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia) and I often miss these kinds of issues.

Please report the issue in the comments at the bottom of the page with the bird description.

### How long are you planning on doing this project?

30 days for the month of September, 2022. If I get positive feedback from the community I will extend the project for another month, until I get bored.

### How do I contact you?

DM (Direct message) me on one of my social media sites. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/funvill), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/funvill/)

### One of the bird names shares my name. I don't like it. Can you change it?

No.

### Why didn't you just post these images on your own social media instead of creating new accounts?

I wanted to give my friends and family who follow my personal accounts the choice if they wanted to see the generated content or not. There are some ethical questions involved in AI generative art that I didn't want to force on my friends and family, instead allowing them to "opt in"

### What hashtag should I use when talking about this project on social media?

\#FlockingAI

### Why did you choose 'Flocking AI' for this project name?

Childish reasons. These early AI/ML algorithms make mistakes, lots of them, I was looking for a name that reflected that. Flocking AI sounds like *F*cking AI*, something you might scream at your computer when they mess up badly.

### Why didn't you use OpenAI DALL-E-2 or any of the other image generation algorithms?

When I started this project I didn't have a [DALL-E-2 OpenAI](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) beta invite. If this project continues past the initial 30 days I would be open to trying any of the other image generation algorithms. Maybe doing a series on each one.

### The text descriptions aren't very good

Agreed, I am open to suggestions for creating better text descriptions. Please contact me if you have a suggestion.
