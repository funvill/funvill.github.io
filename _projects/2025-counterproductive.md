## Counterproductive

This is an art project

- Press the button to reset the 24-hour countdown timer.
- If the timer ever reaches zero, the project ends and will be removed.
- Keep the project alive—press the button

This is a social experiment. To see how long this project survives and how people interact with the button. Will they keep pressing the button to keep it alive?

When the button is pressed a signal is sent to a server that records the time it was pressed. With these logs I can determine how frequently the button was pressed, how long between presses, what time of day the button is pressed most frequently, etc…

This art work was installed in a small park during spring.
